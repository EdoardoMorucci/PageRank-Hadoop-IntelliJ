A 6'3&quot; 185-lb guard, Leonard played high school basketball at Terre Haute Gerstmeyer High School, where he excelled as a tennis player, as well.  He played collegiate basketball at [[Indiana University]], and was selected with the first pick of the second round of the [[1954 NBA Draft]].  He spent most of his seven-year professional playing career with the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] (four years in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], and one year following the team's move to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]), followed by two years with the [[Washington Wizards|Chicago Packers/Zephyrs]]).  In his final season as a player, he also [[player-coach|coached]] the Zephyrs.  The next year, the team moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]; Leonard coached them for one more year.  In 1969, Leonard became the coach of the [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Indiana Pacers]], a position he held for nearly 12 years &amp;ndash; the last four after the franchise moved to the [[NBA]]. Leonard led the Pacers to three ABA championships before the league's merger with the NBA.  Leonard returned to the Pacers in 1985 as a color commentator, first for television (WXIN-59 &amp; WTTV-4), then on radio, where he remains alongside Mark Boyle on [[WIBC (FM)|WIBC]] 1070-AM.  His trademark phrase (for successful three-point shots) is &quot;Boom, Baby!&quot;  == External links == *[http://www.basketball-reference.com/coaches/leonasl01c.html Basketball-Reference.com: Slick Leonard (as coach)]                *[http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/leonasl01.html Basketball-Reference.com: Slick Leonard (as player)] *[http://www.remembertheaba.com/TributeMaterial/Leonard.html Remember the ABA: Slick Leonard]  {{start box}} {{succession box | title=[[Washington Wizards|Chicago Zephyrs/Baltimore Bullets]] Head Coach | before=[[Jack McMahon]]| years=1963&amp;ndash;1964| after= [[Buddy Jeannette]] }} {{succession box | title=[[Indiana Pacers]] Head Coach | before=[[Larry Staverman]]| years=1968&amp;ndash;1980| after= [[Jack McKinney (basketball)|Jack McKinney]] }} {{end box}}  {{1954 NBA Draft}} {{WizardsCoach}} {{Indiana Pacers}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Leonard, Slick}} [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:1932 births]] [[Category:American basketball coaches]] [[Category:American basketball players]] [[Category:Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball players]] [[Category:Baltimore Bullets (1947-1955) draft picks]] [[Category:Minneapolis Lakers players]] [[Category:Los Angeles Lakers players]] [[Category:Chicago Packers expansion draft picks]] [[Category:Chicago Packers players]] [[Category:Chicago Zephyrs players]] [[Category:Chicago Zephyrs coaches]] [[Category:Baltimore Bullets coaches]] [[Category:Indiana Pacers coaches]] [[Category:Player-coaches]] [[Category:National Basketball Association broadcasters]]  [[fr:Bob Leonard]]</text>     </revision>

Peter Mueller was the first Olympic Champion on the 1000&amp;nbsp;m, when this distance was introduced at the [[1976 Winter Olympics]] in [[Innsbruck]]. More international successes followed at the [[World Sprint Speed Skating Championships|World Sprint Championships]], where he won bronze in 1976 and silver in 1977. His last appearance as a speed skater was at the [[1980 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], where he placed 5th in the 1000&amp;nbsp;m, 1.93 seconds behind the winning time of [[Eric Heiden]].  == Coaching ==  After ending his speed skating career, Mueller became a very successful skating coach. He was the coach of [[Bonnie Blair]] when she won two gold medals at the [[1992 Winter Olympics]], [[Dan Jansen]] when he won gold at the [[1994 Winter Olympics]], [[Marianne Timmer]] (two gold medals) and [[Jan Bos]] (silver) at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]], and [[Gianni Romme]] (silver) at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. In addition, several speed skaters winning a total of five World Sprint Championships, one [[World Allround Speed Skating Championships|World Allround Championships]], and one [[European Speed Skating Championships|European Allround Championships]] titles were also coached by him.  Since the 2003/2004 season, Mueller is the coach of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] team. He quickly added to his impressive list of successes as a coach when, at the [[World Single Distance Championships]] of 2005 in [[Inzell]], [[Even Wetten]] (on the 1000&amp;nbsp;m) and [[Rune Stordal]] (on the 1500&amp;nbsp;m) became World Champions.  == Private life ==  Mueller was married to American speed skater [[Leah Poulos]], two times World Sprint Champion and three times Olympic silver medalist, and had two children. Later, he married [[Netherlands|Dutch]] speed skater [[Marianne Timmer]]. He and Timmer are now divorced.

The radar site was operated by the 752nd Aircraft Control and Warning (AC&amp;W) squadron, starting in late [[1951]].  The unit operated and maintained an AN/CPS-6B radar at this site. In [[1958]] this radar was replaced by an AN/FPS-6. A second height-finder radar arrived a year later.   In [[1960]] Empire site began operating an AN/FPS-7 radar, and joined the SAGE system. One of the AN/FPS-6 height-finder radars was supplanted by an AN/FPS-26A in [[1963]].   In [[1964]] Empire site became an ADC/FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]]) Joint Surveillance System (JSS) site.  The 752nd Radar Squadron (SAGE) was deactivated in April [[1978]], and the AN/FPS-26A height-finder was decommissioned in this time frame. The FAA assumed control of the radar operations area except for the AN/FPS-6 height-finder radar (now modified to the AN/FPS-116 variant). The [[National Park Service]] assumed control of the rest of the property.   Circa [[1980]] or [[1981]], the AN/FPS-7 search radar was replaced by an FAA model ARSR-3 search radar. The AN/FPS-116 height-finder radar was removed circa [[1988]]. The ARSR-3 was replaced by an ARSR-4 in the late 1990’s.

The second opening features the [[DATS]] in their new attire, the Digivice Burst using the Air Signal, Ikuto and Falcomon, the Royal Knights, Masaru's father, BanchoLeomon, Masaru's dogtag enlarged, and heavily features the Mega leveled Digimon in action.  *In Japanese, the title is &quot;Digimon Savers&quot;. *In Japanese, the first opening song is called &quot;Gouing!Going!

Formed in [[Toronto]] in 1996, the band consists of [[Andre Ethier (musician)|Andre Ethier]] on vocals and [[guitar]]s, Matthew Carlson on guitar, [[trumpet]] and [[bass guitar|bass]], Chad Ross on guitar, bass and [[mandolin]], Jeremi Madsen on guitar, bass, [[saxophone]] and [[percussion]], Max McCabe-Lokos (using the [[stage name]] ''Age of Danger'') on [[piano]], [[Organ (music)|organ]] and percussion, and Andrew Gunn on guitar and [[drum]]s.  Originally formed as a one-off band for a friend's birthday party, the Snakes kept performing together and soon became a popular draw on Toronto's live music scene. After releasing several 7&quot; singles, the Deadly Snakes released their full-length debut album, ''Love Undone'', in 1999.   The band have toured both Canada and internationally, and have released three further albums. Their 2005 single &quot;Gore Veil&quot;, from the album ''Porcella'', was named the fifth best song of the year by [[CBC Radio 3]]. The album ''Porcella'' was subsequently shortlisted for the inaugural [[Polaris Music Prize]] in 2006.  The Snakes announced their amicable breakup in August 2006, and played their last show on [[August 26]], [[2006]] at the Silver Dollar Room.   [[Andre Ethier (musician)|Andre Ethier]] has ventured out as a solo artist and has released three albums.   ==Discography==  * ''[[Love Undone]]'' ([[Sympathy for the Record Industry]], 1999) * ''[[I'm Not Your Soldier Anymore]]'' ([[In the Red Records|In the Red]], 2001) * ''[[Ode to Joy (album)|Ode to Joy]]'' (In the Red, 2003) * ''[[Porcella]]'' ([[Paper Bag Records]], 2005)  ==External links== *&quot;[http://www.cbcradio3.com/issues/2005_01_28/index.cfm?page=20 Destination Unknown: The Deadly Snakes Cross Vast Musical Terrain]&quot; [[CBC Radio 3]] Live Concert Session * [http://www.newyorknighttrain.com/zine/news/2006/aug/0811.html 2006 article about the band and its demise] from NewYorkNightTrain.com  [[Category:Canadian indie rock groups|Deadly Snakes, The]] [[Category:2000s music groups|Deadly Snakes, The]] [[Category:Toronto musical groups|Deadly Snakes, The]] [[Category:Garage punk|Deadly Snakes]] [[Category:Sympathy for the Record Industry artists|Deadly Snakes]]</text>     </revision>

Calico firearms feature a top-mounted, [[helical]]-feed, high-capacity (50 or 100 round) [[magazine]] that ejects spent shells from a slot in the bottom, making a brass catcher more practical. Interestingly, the Calico 9 mm pistols, carbines and submachine guns use the [[Roller-delayed blowback]] principle which is famously used in the [[Heckler &amp; Koch]] series of firearms.  ==View== Although reviews of the product line were very favorable, Calico has yet to secure big military and law enforcement contracts. Sales were severely curtailed by the introduction of the [[Federal assault weapons ban]] in the 1990s which limited magazine capacity of newly made firearms to ten rounds. Now that that particular legislation has expired, Calico is producing firearms again. Calico weapons are sometimes seen in various movies &amp; science fiction films due to their futuristic appearance. Most notably, the [[Command &amp; Conquer]] series, the M951 (in-game GAU-3 Eliminator) as [[GDI]]'s basic infantry assualt rifle. The company tagline in the 1990s was ''A Revolution in Firepower!''.  ==Products== *.22 LR Pistols **[[Calico M100P|M-100P]] **M-110P *9mm Pistols **[[M950]] Liberty III *Carbines **M-900 **M-951 **[[Calico 960|M960]] **Liberty I and II *Sub-machineguns **M-750 **M-900A **M-950A *.22 LR Carbines **[[Calico M100|M-100]] **M-100S  ==References== * Modern Small Arms - Ian Hogg, ISBN 1-85841-075-4  ==External links== * [http://www.calicolightweaponsystems.com Calico Official Web Site] * [http://207.234.249.73/gunfax/calico/calico.htm Calico Fans Web Site (unofficial)] * [http://world.guns.ru/smg/smg57-e.htm Modern Firearms Calico SMGs site] * [http://notpurfect.com/calico/index.html Shooters Web Ring Calico Site]  [[Category:Firearms manufacturers in the United States]] [[Category:Companies based in Hillsboro, Oregon]]</text>     </revision>

It is located approximately 10 km north of [[Alzey]], and 20 km south-west of [[Mainz]].  Wörrstadt is the seat of the ''[[Verbandsgemeinde]]'' (&quot;collective municipality&quot;) [[Wörrstadt (Verbandsgemeinde)|Wörrstadt]].   == Geography == === Geographical position === Wörrstadt is surrounded by the typical Rhineland-Palatinate cultural landscape: Mostly there's intensive winegrowing, and in the less exposed areas agriculture. The Rhine Hessian landscape is mostly broached and the natural vegetation almost vanished. Wörrstadt presents a for Rhine Hessian distinctive feature: With the &quot;Neuborn&quot;, the municipality owns one of the very rare forests in this region. In this woodland exist many natural springs, whose water supplies the local swimming pool of the municipality, the &quot;Neubornbad&quot;.  The main locality lies on a rise, whereby very beautiful and impressive distant views are possible. From Wörrstadt you can see the &quot;Donnersberg&quot;, the &quot;Wißberg&quot;, as well as the &quot;Taunus&quot;. When the weather is good, you're even able to see the skyline of [[Frankfurt am Main]] at multiple bounds.  The district [[Rommersheim]], former &quot;Eichloch&quot;, lies in a dip and merges imposing into the cultural landscape. At the bound Rommersheim, you're able to enjoy nice views at the Wißberg and into the direction of [[Bad Kreuznach]].  === Neighbour Townships === *[[Saulheim]] *[[Sulzheim]] *[[Gabsheim]] *[[Udenheim]] *[[Schornsheim]] *[[Armsheim]] *[[Gau-Bickelheim]] *[[Gau-Weinheim]] *[[Wallertheim]] *[[Spiesheim]] *[[Ensheim]] *[[Vendersheim]]  == History == === Personalities === [[Adam Elsheimer]], a German painter of the 17th century was born in Wörrstadt. The &quot;Adam-Elsheimer-Straße&quot; is called after him. His parents moved to [[Frankfurt]], so it's discussed if Elsheimer was born in Wörrstadt or in [[Frankfurt]].  Also out of Wörrstadt is the town chronicler [[Nikolaus von Wörrstadt]] (or [[Nicolaus von Werstad]]), that lead in 1428 a rebillion against the patricians, to prevent the town going bankrupt. Later he was captured in [[Straßburg]] by the presumable inventer of the letterpress printing [[Johannes Gutenberg]].  The [[geologist]] and [[impact event]] scientist Dr. [[Günther Graup]] (+2006), who among other things made a name for himself with the exploration of the [[Nördlinger Ries]]. His innovative works helped to understand the Ries-Happening better. He was also involved into the [[apollo program]] and inspected multiple moon-samples ([[Apollo 14]] and [[Apollo 16]]).  === Annexation === * district Rommersheim In 824 B.C., Rommersheim was documentary mentioned the first time. First Rommersheim was called &quot;Eichloch&quot;, before it got changed. The reason for the change was, that &quot;Eichloch&quot; sounded similar to the cuss word &quot;Arschloch&quot;(Asshole). In the 70s it got suburbanized into the municipality Wörrstadt, and is hereby also part of the homonymous collective municipality.  === Associate township === * [[Arney-le-Duc]], [[France]], since 1986  == Politics == === District Council === [[CDU]], [[SPD]], [[Grüne]], [[FWG]], [[BfW]]  === Mayor === * Günther Helmus - SPD (1984 - 2004) * Ingo Kleinfelder - SPD (2004 - today)  == Culture ==  === Places of Interest === * Former [[Thurn und Taxis|Thurn-und-Taxis]]-postal office * Laurentius- Church, containing a genuine Stumm- Organ from 1759 * Neunröhren- Fountain, built in 1608.

The term '''analogue''' is used in [[literary history]] in two related senses: * a work which resembles another in terms of one or more [[Motif (literature)|motif]]s, [[Fictional character|characters]], scenes, phrases or events. * an individual motif, character, scene, event or phrase which resembles one found in another work.  Similarities may be fortuitous, in which case the merit of establishing an analogue is that it makes it possible to see how works from different authors (perhaps also in different languages, periods, genres) treat similar characters or motifs. But the term is used  particularly in the study of [[legend]]s, [[folk tale]]s and [[oral literature]] for works that have features in common either because they derive from a shared tradition or because they both rework material from a specific older text, which may or may not still survive.  For example, the [[Deluge (mythology)|Deluge]] stories in the [[Bible]] and the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] are analogues.   However, where one work draws directly on another, the term ''analogue'' is inappropriate: the earlier work is the ''source'' of the later.   In the literature of earlier periods, it may not be easy to decide whether a particular work is a direct source for another, especially if there are uncertainties of dating. The phrase ''sources and analogues'' is used to cover ''all'' material relevant to the creation of a particular work.

It is run over a distance of 2 miles (3,219 metres) on the Old Course at [[Cheltenham Racecourse]], and it takes place annually during the [[Cheltenham Festival]] in March. There are twelve fences to be jumped in the race.  It was given its present name in 1969 to honour the racehorse [[Arkle]], a three-time winner of the [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]]. Prior to this the race had been known as the '''Cotswold Chase'''.  Since 1991 six winners of the race have gone on to win the [[Queen Mother Champion Chase]], while a further five winners have been placed. This contrasts heavily with the situation beforehand, when [[Flyingbolt]] was the only winner to subsequently win the Champion Chase. The 1979 winner passed the post first in the following year's Champion Chase only to be disqualified some time after the event because of a positive drugs test.  ==Winners== * ''Amateur jockeys indicated by &quot;Mr&quot;.'' {| class = &quot;sortable&quot;

It was the site of the [[Freestyle Skiing]] events of the [[2006 Olympic Winter Games]].  Together with the villages of [[Sestriere]], [[Claviere]], [[Cesana Torinese]], [[San Sicario]] and [[Mongenèvre]], in [[France]], it makes up the [[Via Lattea]] (Milky Way) skiing area.  Since the beginning of the 19th century, Sauze d'Oulx has been the exclusive destination for the [[Turin]] aristocracy, with its famous winter resort Sportinia and is still a skiing favourite because of its natural location.  Sauzed'olux is a very lively resort, and is popular with younger skiers and snowboarders.  It features runs for participants of all levels, as well as a great apres-ski, boasting a huge number of bars and restaurants.  For years it has been a favourite destination for English skiers, who represent more than 70% of the tourism and who have now become part of the resident population.    &lt;BR&gt; {{Province of Turin}}  {{coord|45|02|N|6|51|E|display=title}}  [[Category:2006 Winter Olympics venues]]  {{Turin-geo-stub}}  [[de:Sauze d’Oulx]] [[eo:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[fr:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[id:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[it:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[nl:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[ja:サウゼ・ドゥルクス]] [[nap:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[no:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[pms:Sauze d'Ols]] [[pl:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[pt:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[sl:Sauze D'Oulx]] [[fi:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[sv:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[vo:Sauze d'Oulx]]</text>     </revision>

The [[Review Body]] invites evidence from a range of stakeholders, including the [[British Medical Association|BMA]] and the government, and then decides how much doctors' pay should increase in the following year.  In principle the DDRB matches doctors' pay with others doing similar jobs in the public and private sector, and ensures that doctors' pay continues to match that of others doing comparable jobs, and on comparable incomes. In practice it has been suggested that the DDRB has failed to maintain doctors' incomes in line with others, partly because of pressure from the treasury, and partly because the government has refused to fully meet the DDRB recommendations. There is evidence that doctors' income has been falling over many years. [http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/331/7531/1520 McManus IC.

The system has four passenger stations and a maintenance &amp; control centre, and is run by two cars, one for each route. The system uses [[automated guideway transit]] technology, although for the moment it is driven manually, and exists primarily for the benefit of office workers and a few local residents.  ==History== [[Image:Las Colinas APT System 1.jpg|thumb|right|The APT system in action. Here, the people mover is just outside Bell Tower Station.]] The community of Las Colinas was founded in 1973, but construction of the APT did not begin until 1979. The first phase construction contained 1.4 miles of guideway and four stations.&lt;ref name=jonbell&gt;{{cite web| url=http://web.presby.edu/~jtbell/transit/Irving/| work=Jon Bell's Transit Pages| title=Las Colinas Peoplemover (APT)| }}&lt;/ref&gt; (At this time, Phase 1 remains the only fully constructed and operational track: see [[Las Colinas APT System#Current Operation|Current Operation]] for more details.)  Although the guideways were in place by 1983, the system was not finalised and opened until 1986, following the purchase of four cars, power and control infrastructure from [[AEG|AEG-Westinghouse]],&lt;ref name=jonbell /&gt; which has since been purchased by [[Bombardier]].&lt;ref name=dcurd&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dcurd.com/| title=Dallas County Utility and Reclamation District| }}&lt;/ref&gt; Passenger service began three years later, on [[18 June]] [[1989]], with the first five years of operation to be overseen by the vendor.&lt;ref name=jonbell /&gt; This was part of a deal that reportedly cost $45 million.&lt;ref name=facilities&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.facilities.ufl.edu/cp/pdf/PeopleMovers.pdf| format=PDF| author=Tzveta Panayotova (Facilities Planning and Construction UFL)| title=People Movers - Systems and Case Studies| }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 1993, the system was closed due to rising expenses and a lack of demand. Obviously, plans for future expansion were put on hold, not just because of the low demand for the current system, but because the real estate crash in the Dallas area in the mid-1980s had reduced demand for development in the rest of Las Colinas.  Las Colinas saw a revival of fortune towards the latter half of the 1990s, and the system reopened accordingly in December 1996. Rising occupancy rates in the area saw a renewed call for expansion, but the current system still runs only on a limited basis.&lt;ref name=jerryschneider&gt;{{cite web| url=http://faculty.washington.edu/jbs/itrans/lascol.htm| work=Jerry Schneider's Innovative Transportation Technologies| title=Las Colinas Peoplemover Infopage| }}&lt;/ref&gt;  == Operations ==  {| {{Railway line header}} {{BS-table}} {{BS3|uKBFa-ELEV||||Xerox Center}} {{BS3|uELEV|uKBFa-ELEV|||Lincoln Place}} {{BS3|uELEV|uWBRÜCKE-ELEV|||Lake Carolyn}} {{BS3|uABZrg-ELEV|uSTRrf-ELEV||}} {{BS3|uBHF-ELEV||||Bell Tower}} {{BS3|uBHF-ELEV||||Cigna Tower}} {{BS3|uKDSe||||Maintenance and Control Center}} |} |}  Since the 1996 reopening, the system has been run by the ''Dallas County Utility and Reclamation District''. It runs from 10:30am to 2pm on weekdays, mostly for the benefit of office workers riding to Bell Tower Station to eat lunch at the restaurants located there.&lt;ref name=jerryschneider /&gt;  The system is operated manually, with only two trains running as demand dictates. The drivers use a small control panel that is equipped with an emergency and maintenance controls.   ===Track Routing===  The initial track layout has not changed since Phase 1 was opened in 1986. There are two tracks.  *'''Track 1''' - This track forks north at Bell Tower and ends at Xerox Center (aka Millennium Center). *'''Track 2''' - This track forks east at Bell Tower and ends at Lincoln Place (aka Equity Offices).  ===Stations===  The four original stations and maintenance center are still the only operational stopping points for passengers on the APT system. These stations are:  *'''Maintenance and Control Center''' - Not used by passengers, each train starts its first morning journey here. The control centre is manned by an overseer during times of operation. *'''Cigna Tower''' - On both tracks 1 and 2, this is located at 600 E. Las Colinas Boulevard. *'''Bell Tower''' - The main station at 27 Mandalay Canal, this is accessible on both tracks, and is located above the Mandalay Canal. The numerous dining options, as well as the Tower's central location within Las Colinas, makes this the most popular station with both local workers and visitors. *'''Lincoln Place''' - Located at the end of Track 2, and also known as Equity Offices at 909 E. Las Colinas Boulevard. This stop is mostly used by office workers in that building. *'''Xerox Center''' - Also known as Millennium Center, this forms the terminus for Track 1.&lt;ref name=dcurd /&gt;  ===Vehicles=== Out of the four vehicles purchased in 1986, only two are used on day-to-day service.  ==Future Expansion==  Plans to expand the system have existed since the inception of the APT; a number of guideway pillars without tracks already exist north of the Xerox Center station. Track 2 has enough space for two lines, although currently only one is placed on the guideways.  ==Controversy==  Some, such as [[Gary N. Bourland]], author of ''Las Colinas: The Inside Story of America's Premier Urban Development'', cite cases of the APT System being viewed as an expensive [[white elephant]].&lt;ref name=happyme&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.happyme.com/las_colinas.htm| author=Gary N. Bourland| publisher=Happyme Publishing| title=Las Colinas: The Inside Story of America's Premier Urban Development| id=ISBN 0960935037 | }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been cited as one of the contributors towards the high rate of taxation in the Las Colinas area.&lt;ref name=foxglen&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxglen.org/LCHistory.htm| author=Lee Powell| publisher=The Dallas Morning News| title=Ranch to riches: A city's tale - Las Colinas' growth marked by foresight, careful planning| }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Northwest Corridor Major Investment Study - carried out on behalf of the [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] Board of Directors - sees the potential to integrate the APT system into the DART public transit network, showing that some demand remains for the service's continuation and even expansion.&lt;ref name=irvinglanduse&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ci.irving.tx.us/economic_development/Land_Use_Study/part2.asp| author=City of Irving| title=Northwest Corridor Land Use Study| }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ==References== {{Reflist}}  {{USpplmver}}  [[Category:Rapid transit in the United States]]</text>     </revision>

Since the introduction of the [[Principal Officials Accountability System]] on [[July 1st]], [[2002]], secretaries of departments and secretaries of bureaux (but not the other five officials) are political appointees. Before that all principal officials were civil servants. The civil servants who held the positions of secretaries of bureaux have their titles changed to permanent secretaries, and are no longer principal officials.  ==List== *Secretaries of departments **[[Chief Secretary for Administration]] **[[Financial Secretary (Hong Kong)|Financial Secretary]] **[[Secretary for Justice]] *Deputy secretaries of departments **''None'' *Secretaries of Bureaux  **[[Secretary for the Civil Service]] **[[Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology|Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development]]  **[[Secretary for Constitutional Affairs|Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs]]   **[[Secretary for Economic Development and Labour|Secretary for Development]] **[[Secretary for Education and Manpower|Secretary for Education]] **[[Secretary for the Environment, Transport and Works|Secretary for the Environment]] **[[Secretary for the Environment, Transport and Works|Secretary for Transport and Housing]] **[[Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury]] **[[Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food|Secretary for Food and Health]] **[[Secretary for Home Affairs]] **[[Secretary for Labour and Welfare]] **[[Secretary for Security]] *Directors of Bureaux **[[Commissioner, Independent Commission Against Corruption]] **[[Director of Audit]] **[[Commissioner of Police]]  **[[Director of Immigration]]  **[[Commissioner of Customs and Excise]]  ==External links== *[http://www.gov.hk/en/about/govdirectory/po/index.htm Principal Officials of the Hong Kong SAR government] *[http://www.info.gov.hk/basic_law/fulltext/content0204.htm Chapter IV: Political Structure - Basic Law] *[http://www.info.gov.hk/info/name-e.htm Who's Who]  {{HK Principal Officials}}  [[category:Hong Kong Government]] [[category:Hong Kong-related lists]]</text>     </revision>

It was founded by Thomas Hope Robinson in [[1883]] and has been in continual publication ever since, adding an internet and email daily news service in [[1996]]. The company began publishing directories in the 1960s, which led to a joint venture with [[Lloyd's Register]] in 2001, now known as Lloyd's Register - Fairplay Ltd.   It's believed Thomas Hope Robinson was a merchant seaman who turned his hand to publishing on coming ashore in the UK.  In the first issue he wrote: &quot;There is so little Fairplay in the world.  If our own efforts succeed, we shall have taken the first steps towards promoting the habit of calling things by their right name and looking at them through uncoloured spectacles.&quot;  This &quot;raison d'etre&quot; has appeared in every subsequent issue of Fairplay magazine, an archive of which is available to view at the company headquarters.  The organisation is based in [[Redhill, Surrey]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] and has offices in America, Singapore, Sweden and a network of correspondents world-wide.  == External links == {{nautical portal}} *[http://www.fairplay.co.uk Fairplay] *[http://www.lrfairplay.com Lloyd's Register - Fairplay]  [[Category:Business magazines]] [[Category:Boat magazines]] [[Category:Merchant marine]]</text>     </revision>

Play was suspended through [[World War I]] and after the war, in [[1919]], they merged with another football side, ''FC Teutonia''. The following year, the winter sports club ''Wintersportverein Steinach'' also joined and remained part of the club until [[1926]]. From [[1933]] to [[1936]], ''Steinach'' played in the [[Gauliga Mitte]], one of sixteen regional leagues formed through the reorganization of German football under the [[Third Reich]]. They finished second in this league in 1933-34, were relegated in [[1937]] and returned for a season in [[1939]] before sitting out for the duration of [[World War II]]. The club resumed play in [[East Germany|East Germany's]] Bezirksliga Suhl in [[1952]] as ''BSG Motor Steinach''. Through the late 50's and early 60's the team bounced up and down between the second and third division Liga and 2.Liga. They earned promotion to the top-flight DDR Oberliga where they played the [[1964]] and [[1965]] seasons before falling back. With [[German re-unification]] in 1990 the club took on the name ''SV 08 Steinach'' and plays today in the Landesliga Thüringen (V).  ''Steinach'' has a number of other sports departments and offers its members winter sports, bowling, table tennis, volleyball, gymnastics aund Tae Kwon Do.  ==External links== *[http://www.sv08-steinach.de/ Official team site]  {{fb start}} {{Landesliga Thüringen}} {{fb end}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Steinach}} [[Category:German football clubs]] [[Category:East German football clubs]] [[Category:Thuringia football clubs]] [[Category:Football (soccer) clubs established in 1908]]  [[de:SV 08 Steinach]]</text>     </revision>

The song was produced by Rohan &quot;Snowcone&quot; Fuller and received a positive reception from music [[critic]]s. The song was released as the second U.S. [[single (music)|single]] in the first quarter of 2006 and reached number one in the [[United States]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and became Paul's third number one hit single. It reached the top ten in [[Canada]] and [[France]] and the top twenty in the [[United Kingdom]], peaking at #11 there. In [[Australia]], &quot;Temperature&quot; debuted at number nineteen but quickly found its way to number five the following weeks.   &quot;Temperature&quot; became [[Sean Paul]]'s biggest hit single in the US. In Australia it became a smash hit, with Sean Paul making interview appearances on the Paul Celoni Radio Show, and shows alike. Even though it only spent one week at #1, as opposed to &quot;Get Busy&quot; and its three weeks on top, &quot;Temperature&quot; showed extreme longevity on The [[Billboard Hot 100]] spending 17 weeks in the top 10. Until [[Nelly Furtado]] and [[Timbaland]]'s &quot;[[Promiscuous (song)|Promiscuous]], this was the longest run in the top ten for a single in 2006. On top of that it became Sean Paul's first single to sell an excess of one million digital downloads . However, as of January 2006 is still only certified gold for this achievement.  The song uses the dancehall [[riddim]] &quot;Applause&quot;.  It was also used in the game ''[[Dance Dance Revolution SuperNOVA 2]]''.  Officially, there are two versions of the song. Only the use of the riddim makes both versions different.  It can be heard in the 2007 film, ''[[Norbit]]''.  ==Music video== [[Image:TemperatureVideo.png|thumb|left|The winter sequence from the music video.]]  In this video Sean Paul is seen dancing quite close with female dancers. The first dance sequence was with blowing leaves, centered in fall. Then as weather gets colder, he is in the snow with the [[thermometer]] frozen, centered in winter. The third sequence is in the rain, centered around spring. Finally he's at a tanning salon squirting sunscreen, centered around summer.

There are 3,000 working men's clubs in the UK. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmciu.org.uk/MANAGEMENT.htm] {{Dead link|date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  == Purpose == Despite the educational ambitions, most working men's clubs are recreational. Typically, clubs have a bar, [[snooker]] or [[eight-ball|pool]] tables, and many provide food. They often provide entertainment such as [[Bingo (UK)|bingo]], [[raffle]]s, live music and comedy.   == Membership and structure == A working men's club is a non-profit organisation run by members through a committee, usually elected annually. Each club has rules which tend to be vigorously enforced. The committee will discipline members (common punishments being a warning, or a ban for a period) for violations. Despite the name, women are allowed to be members in many clubs, and all clubs allow entry to women. Non-members are not allowed entry unless signed in by a member.  While all members pay an annual fee, the primary income comes from alcohol. A club will retain paid staff, such as barmen, stewards, caretakers and cleaners.  == Club and Institute Union == Most clubs affiliate to the [[Working Men's Club and Institute Union]] (commonly known as the CIU or C&amp;IU).  The CIU is affiliated to the Committee of Registered Clubs Associations or [[CORCA]]. A member of one affiliated club is entitled to use the facilities of other clubs.  The CIU has two purposes; to provide a national voice  for clubs, and to provide discounted products and services for clubs.  === Brewery === Until 2004, the CIU ran a brewery in [[Dunston, Tyne and Wear]]. This produced ales and lagers under the Federation brand. The brewery and brands were sold to [[Scottish &amp; Newcastle]] for £16.2M &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.s-n.com/sn_acq/ir/finnews/rnsitem?id=1089792001nRNSN8162A | title=Scottish &amp; Newcastle – Financial News | publisher=Scottish &amp; Newcastle plc | date=2004-07-14 | accessdate=2008-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, although CIU clubs still receive discounted beer. These discounts are passed to members.  == Impact of July 2007 smoking ban == In December 2007 a poll by the ''British Institute of Innkeeping'' and the ''Federation of Licensed Victuallers' Associations'' found that overall revenue was 7.3% down as more men opted to drink at home where they could also smoke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Working men's clubs hardest hit by smoking ban | work=[[Daily Telegraph]] | date=2007-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  == References == &lt;references/&gt;  [[Category:Clubs and societies]]</text>     </revision>

The country went by the abbreviation ''ENG'' and used the [[St George's Cross]] as flag and [[Land of Hope and Glory]] as the [[national anthem]].  Diver [[Tony Ally]] bore England's flag at the opening ceremony whilst shooter [[Mick Gault]] bore the flag during the closing ceremony, both chosen by a vote of England  team managers from a list of nominations.  ==Expectations== England entered these Games, held in [[Melbourne]]; [[Australia]], after playing hosts to the [[2002 Commonwealth Games|previous Games]] in [[Manchester]] in Manchester 2002. The medal tally was not expected to be a large as at the 2002 Games, where England had a home advantage and achieved a total of 166 medals including 54 Gold, 51 Silver and 60 Bronze to finish in second place behind Australia. A strong second place in the medal tally was, however, still expected.  The country sent a large team, with competitors taking part in every sport in the schedule. The largest teams were sent in athletics and swimming and it was in these sports, along with cycling and shooting that the team hoped to win most medals.

It is located 27 km south of the town of [[Peace River, Alberta|Peace River]], along [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway 2]].  ==Demographics== According to the 2006 census, Nampa has a:  *population of 360 living in 168 [[house|dwellings]], a 3.2% decrease from 2001 *land area of {{km2 to mi2|1.86|abbr=yes|wiki=yes}}  *and a [[population density]] of {{Pop density km2 to mi2|193.8| spell=UK | abbr=yes}}.&lt;ref name=statcan2006&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;Code1=4817039&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=48&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Nampa&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=All&amp;GeoLevel=&amp;GeoCode=4817039 | title= Nampa - Community Profile | author= Statistics Canada| authorlink= Statistics Canada| year= [[Canada 2006 Census|Census 2006]] | accessdate= 2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ==History== *1916: Originally the area was known as &quot;Tank&quot; named after the water tank and pump house built by the railway when it arrived. *1924: The first post office is opened.  It was later decided a new name should be given to the community. An aboriginal leader came up with the current name of &quot;Nampa&quot;. Nampa means &quot;the place&quot; in aboriginal. Nampa is also the name of a community in Idaho.  ==Economy== The principal industries in the area are agriculture, forestry, oil and gas.  One of the largest employers of the area is Boucher Brothers Lumber Mill located just outside the village, about a 3 kilometers northwest of Nampa. This mill employed approximately 56 people and ships lumber to a number of different areas. It has been in the area since the 1980s. In April 2008, Boucher Brothers laid off 28 people because of the poor [[United States]] housing market, softwood tariff, and the increasing [[Canadian]] [[dollar]].&lt;ref&gt;Justin Pot,&quot;[http://cgi.bowesonline.com/pedro.php?id=15&amp;x=story&amp;xid=390869 Record-Gazette],&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Northern Forage located on the west side of town compresses hay bails that are shipped to Japan. This business also has a number of employees.  Farmers from around the community come to Nampa to deliver their grain at the Great Northern Grain Terminals, located at the north side of town. From here the grain is shipped to [[Falher, Alberta]] which is 35 km south of Nampa. Besides raising [[cattle]] some farmers have herds of [[buffalo]].  ==Events and Attractions== The Annual Farmers Day and Family Fair is held in mid June each year in Nampa. The Heart River Golf Club holds its annual open in mid July. In the winter months, many look forward to the Family Day events in February, a day filled with [[snowshoeing]], hayrides, free [[skating]], [[curling]] and [[hotdogs]] is enjoyed by all ages.  ==See also== *[[List of communities in Alberta]] *[[Villages of Alberta]]  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{Subdivisions of Alberta|villages=yes}}  [[Category:Villages in Alberta]]  {{Alberta-geo-stub}}</text>     </revision>

The bill was passed in the wake of a number of [[Controversies about the Boy Scouts of America|controversies involving the Boy Scouts of America]], such as their exclusion of gays and atheists, and subsequent attempts to limit government support of the organization. ==Legislative language== In particular, the bill states: *''No Federal law... shall be construed to limit any Federal agency from providing any form of support for a youth organization (including the Boy Scouts of America or any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America)that would result in that Federal agency providing less support to that youth organization... than was provided during the preceding fiscal year.''  *''The Secretary of Defense shall provide at least the same level of support under this section for a national or world Boy Scout Jamboree as was provided under this section for the preceding national or world Boy Scout Jamboree.''  *''No State or unit of general local government that has a designated open forum, limited public forum, or nonpublic forum and that is a recipient of assistance under this title shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to meet to, or discriminate against, any youth organization, including the Boy Scouts of America or any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America, that wishes to conduct a meeting or otherwise participate in that designated open forum, limited public forum, or nonpublic forum.''  In July 2005, the Senate voted 98 to 0 to include the bill in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 (H.R.1815, Sec. 1058){{ref|Bill}}, which was signed into law on December 30, 2005. {{ref|BSALegal}}   ==Impact== It is unknown what the ultimate effects of this act will be on the on-going [[Boy Scouts of America membership controversies|controversy regarding governmental support of the Boy Scouts]].

An instructive but obsolete route to Cp* complexes involves the use of hexamethyl [[Dewar benzene]].

Organotransition Metal Chemistry: Fundamental Concepts and Applications. (1986) p. 105 &lt;/ref&gt;  Relative to the more common cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligand, pentamethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp*) offers certain features that are often advantageous.  Being more electron-rich, Cp* is a stronger donor and is less easily removed from the metal.  Consequently its complexes exhibit increased thermal stability.  Its steric bulk allows the isolation of complexes with fragile ligands.   Its bulk also attenuates intermolecular interactions, decreasing the tendency to form polymeric structures.  Its complexes also tend to be highly soluble in non-polar solvents.  ==See also== * [[Methylcyclopentadiene]]  ==References== {{reflist}} &lt;!-- relevance?

Directed by [[Tomás Gutiérrez Alea]], the story is based on a novel by [[Edmundo Desnoes]]. It was Alea's fifth film, and probably his most famous worldwide. The film gathered several awards at international film festivals.  ==Story==  Sergio, a wealthy bourgeois aspiring writer, decides to stay in Cuba even though his wife and friends flee to Miami. Sergio looks back over the changes in Cuba, from the [[Cuban Revolution]] to the [[Cuban missile crisis|missile crisis]], the effect of living in an [[underdevelopment|underdeveloped]] country, and his relations with his girlfriends Elena and Hanna. ''Memories of Underdevelopment'' is a complex character study of alienation during the turmoil of social changes. The film is told in a highly subjective point of view through a fragmented narrative that remembles the way memories function.   ==See also== {{portalpar|Cuba|Flag of Cuba.svg}} *[[Cinema of Cuba]]  ==External links== *{{imdb title | id=0063291 | name=Memorias del Subdesarrollo}} * [http://film.guardian.co.uk/Century_Of_Films/Story/0,,140598,00.html Derek Malcolm of the Guardian places &quot;Memorias del Subdesarrollo&quot; at number 54 in his 100 greatest movies]  {{CinemaofCuba}}  [[Category:Cuban films]] [[Category:1968 films]] [[Category:Spanish-language films]]  [[es:Memorias del Subdesarrollo]]</text>     </revision>

Axenrot played with [[Opeth]] on their last five tours, filling in for then drummer [[Martin Lopez]]. On [[May 12]], [[2006]], he officially joined the band as Lopez left permanently. Axenrot has been jokingly been referred to as the ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' character [[Legolas]] by band members and fans. &quot;He's kind of pretty, looks like [[Legolas]],&quot; remarked [[Mikael Åkerfeldt]] who has also named him, &quot;the most confused man I have ever met&quot;. On Blabbermouth.com Åkerfeldt also said that Axenrot completed his drumming part for eleven tracks on the new Opeth album 'Watershed' in just seven days. In an interview, Martin said, &quot;Rudiments and technique in general were encouraged by my drum teacher Stig Bendric, who has passed away now, but had always played in the army and with the Norrköping Symphonic Orchestra. He was a huge [[Buddy Rich]] fan, and could play really impressive stuff. It made me appreciate the sense of swing when playing&quot;.  He is currently dating Nathalie Lorichs who contributed vocals on Coil from Opeth's [[Watershed (Opeth album)|Watershed]] and they both work together on a project with Axenrot on guitars.  == External links == * [http://www.drummerszone.com/artists/artist.php?artistNR=f009a3e60e083d7a655119e0aa40b947 Biography at drummerszone.com] * [http://www.drummerszone.com/news/newsItem.php?n01ID=2425&amp;type=5 Interview by drummerszone.com]  {{DEFAULTSORT:Axenrot, Martin}} {{drummer-stub}}  {{Opeth}} {{blo}} [[Category:1979 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Opeth members]] [[Category:Swedish heavy metal drummers]]  [[es:Martin Axenrot]] [[it:Martin Axenrot]] [[pl:Martin Axenrot]] [[fi:Martin Axenrot]] [[sv:Martin Axenrot]]</text>     </revision>

It originally aired on [[May 7]], [[2006]].  ==Plot== Looking for a way to get easy money, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]], and [[Nelson Muntz|Nelson]] go around town spray-painting people’s addresses on their curbs and making them pay them ten dollars for the unsolicited service. It turns out to be a success after all, but after they already add the “7” and the “4” to the Simpsons’ curb, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] tells them that he won’t pay, so they leave without finishing. The next day, the letter carrier delivers them someone else’s mail, thinking that their address is 74 Evergreen Terrace. Homer continues to accept the mail. He gets steaks from Omaha, and even accepts a wedding invitation to Scott Weingarten’s cousin’s wedding (although he doesn't know that Scott is a blind rich man). One day, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] gets a letter claiming that she has won a contest from a magazine she doesn’t even subscribe to. Her prize is that a maid will clean the house for a day while she relaxes. Not wanting to look bad, Marge cleans the house until it’s entirely spotless. That is, except for a small stain on the kitchen floor. She combines all of her different cleaners together, but the fumes make her woozy. She falls and hits her head on a stool. When she wakes up in the hospital, it is revealed that she has [[amnesia]] and can’t even remember her own family.  After the insurance coverage runs out, the family returns home, with Marge still having amnesia. The home environment quickly jogs her memory of her children, and she also recognizes [[Ned Flanders]] when he appears at the window, but Homer is still a stranger to her since the remembrance of Ned block Homer's memory.  Homer tries to get her to remember him, but to no avail. He shows Marge the family album, even telling her &quot;Here's me beating up former President Bush, and here's me beating up current President Bush&quot; while showing her pictures of the events. He then decides to try to make her fall in love with him again, but he only makes her disgusted in him, saying that the greatest thing that’s ever happened to her was forgetting about him since Homer says that they had first been making love on a golf course. Marge says that she isn't a kind of girl who will make love on a golf course (later there is seen that [[Principal Skinner]] and [[Edna Krabappel]] had been making love in that same golf course). She kicks him out of the house. Then Homer moves to the Springfield retirement castle to [[Abe Simpson|his father]], who asks him that how long Homer stays there, and Homer answers that he will stay at least to the death of Abe. [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Patty and Selma]] excitedly take Marge to a speed dating event, and she meets a man who shares her interests. But Lenny and Carl had called Homer and told him that Marge is dating an other guy. Homer quickly goes there. When Marge tells him that she has amnesia and three kids, he leaves her. Homer catches up with him and scolds him for leaving her, saying that she is the most beautiful and kind woman he’ll ever meet. Still, he leaves. Marge then tells Homer that even though she may not remember him, he knows the most wonderful things about her. As they drive back home, Homer brings up beer, and she suddenly remembers him. The episode ends with Homer and Marge driving into the sunset. During the credits, Homer is asking Marge if she knows any of the people listed.  ==Cultural references== *The scene where Marge and Homer go to a wedding uninvited is similar to various scenes from ''[[Wedding Crashers]]''. *Homer writes on the sidewalk that the [[1974 Oakland Athletics season|’74 Oakland A's]] are the best team ever. Soon after, several members of the team drive by and thank Homer for remembering them. [[Sal Bando]] and [[Gene Tenace]], two members of the actual team, make cameo appearances. *Marge’s quote, “''Et tu'', Zud?” is a reference to “''[[Et tu, Brute?]]''” from ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' by [[Shakespeare]]. *The title of this episode is a reference to ''[[Regarding Henry]]'', which revolves around Harrison Ford's character recovering from amnesia and brain damage.  {{wikiquote|The_Simpsons#Regarding_Margie_.5B17.20.5D|“Regarding Margie”}} {{portal|The Simpsons}}  [[Category:The Simpsons episodes, season 17]] [[Category:2006 television episodes]]  [[es:Regarding Margie]] [[fr:À propos de Marge]]</text>     </revision>

Frasier mentions in passing that schools often give teenagers who want to be a parent a bag of flour to look after and watch for a week, and Niles takes the idea seriously and decides to try it. Over the week, the baby is bumped, soaked, set on fire, poked with a chopstick, and finally gored by Eddie the dog.  Meanwhile, Frasier is asked to sign a card for a work colleague. He jokingly writes &quot;Dear Clarence, you're not getting older, you're just getting closer to death&quot;, before finding to his horror that the card is not for a birthday; Clarence has had a [[kidney transplantation|kidney transplant]]. To avoid embarrassment he has to buy the exact same card, sneak into the hospital to get the old one back, and recreate everyone else's messages letter-for-letter. When returning the card he sees Clarence, who is delighted that Frasier &quot;went to the trouble to visit when the rest of those bums didn't even send me a card&quot;.  ==Episode Title Cards== *''Special delivery'' *''Flour child'' *''No guts, no glory''  ==Memorable Quotations== ''Frasier is attempting to reassure a taxi driver in [[childbirth|labour]].

If we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it right. ''(finds the flour, reads)'' “Bleached, 100% fat free, best when kept in an airtight container”.

Here is an excerpt from &quot;Darksword Adventures&quot; by Weis and Hickman which describes Simkin's origin: &quot;Joram makes two observations about Simkin: first, that Simkin plays the game for the game's sake, and second, that he is magic personified.&quot;  His knowledge of everyone and everything that occurs in the world makes him a player in every event from the most mundane to matters that the very world depends on.  He is amoral, self-absorbed, unfeeling yet handsome (when he is not a garishly colored teapot), charming and extremely funny.  ==Characteristics== Simkin is often referred to as &quot;the fool&quot;.  His known abilities are to shape change into anything at all at a whim.  He can also cast various  powerful spells.  The character has little to no concern over what happens to the people around him and enjoys causing chaos just to see what will happen.  ==Other Occurrences== &quot;Simkin&quot; is a common nickname chosen by many net geeks on various chat and gaming servers.  &quot;Simkin&quot; is also a high-level lightweight embeddable scripting language which works with Java or C++ and XML.  ==External links== * [http://www.simkin.co.uk Simkin homepage]  [[Category:Characters in written fantasy]]</text>     </revision>

There is no copyvio here, as there is no list!  While the article is currently a stub and cannot ever be as thorough as it should be sans copyright law, I'm willing to trust that it could turn into something rather useful.  Quadell is quite correct that, even as it stands right now, it accurately describes what the list is and how the names are arranged.

This is a useful referrent point for other articles that might be about people on the list.  Stubs can grow, that being a prime Wikipedia mechanism.  The article is certainly about a more notable topic than 90 percent of the lists that proliferate around here.  If you feel the article is PoV, then don't delete it, edit it to make it neutral PoV, that is the Wikipedia way. [[User:Hu|Hu]] 18:38, 26 February 2006 (UTC) (see also endorsement of user Volatile's vote) *'''Weak Keep'''. I believe the article is still useful (provides something to link to when mentioned in articles about those recognized by the list). Provided that the stub gets cleaned up a bit, the stub should remain. I'm not familiar with this list, but if Time publishes it on a yearly basis, wouldn't it be more appropriate to have a general article &quot;TIME Magazine's 100 Most Influential People&quot; and have all descendent lists (...of 2003, ...of 2004, ...of 2005,etc.) redirect there?

The album featured many trance songs that were receiving a lot of [[dance club]] play at the time, including [[Three Drives on a Vinyl]]'s ''Greece 2000'' and the [[Paul van Dyk]] remix of [[Binary Finary]]'s popular ''1998''.  The later releases in the series were based on this template. DJs featured in this series included [[Dave Ralph]] and [[Quivver]] (''[[Tranceport 2]]'' and ''[[Transport 5]]'', respectively). After Vol. 3, the series changed its name to ''Transport'' to better reflect the evolving popular club sounds and the incorporation of genres other than trance. There were 6 albums in the series, spanning 4 years. In 2003, the most popular trance started changing its sound from the tech-trance featured in the series to a much more epic sound being pushed by DJs like [[Armin van Buuren]], thus lessening the series' popularity{{Fact|date=March 2007}}; it ended for good after Kinetic's [[Bankruptcy|demise]] in early 2004.  == Entries in the series == *1998: [[Paul Oakenfold]] ''[[Tranceport (album)|Tranceport]]'' *1999: [[Dave Ralph]] ''[[Tranceport 2]]'' *2000: [[Sandra Collins]] ''[[Tranceport 3]]'' *2001: [[Max Graham]] ''[[Transport 4]]'' *2001: [[Quivver]] ''[[Transport 5]]'' *2002: [[Trendroid]] ''[[Transport 6]]''  [[Category:DJ mix album series]]</text>     </revision>

His master's [[thesis]] was later published as the Vietnam War novel ''One to Count Cadence'' in 1969.

The use of tools is one of the primary means by which humans are distinguished from animals. Tools are the parents of all other antiques. Most manmade objects were made with the use of tools and great effort goes into the creation of newer and better tools to solve the production problems of the day. The study of antique tools provides a glimpse of human development and cultural preferences through history.  People collect and use antique tools for a variety of reasons - some say they are better made than modern tools, and perform their jobs better. Others appreciate the handcrafting that went into their manufacture or their rarity or aesthetic value. Informally, those preferring hand tools to power tools are sometimes referred to as [[galoot]]s.  The creation of a tool often makes possible the creation of more advanced tools. Advanced tools made possible the manufacture of internal-combustion engines, automobiles, and computers. In the future new devices will come along. But even the most advanced of these owes tribute to the most basic hand tools for their existence. Among those who like to collect, some may do so as part of a rigorous study program - they want to catalog all types of a specific tool, for example. Some collectors may wish to preserve some of the past for future generations. Some may collect as a financial investment. Some collect tools to use them - to be able to create things with them. Others perceive tools as works of art, or as fascinating mechanical design specimens.     With the advent of the Internet, sites have been created to assist collectors in sharing information. For example, those interested in collecting/restoring older power tools can utilize the resources at [http://www.owwm.com/ Old WoodWorking Machines] to locate and/or identify older power tools they may run across. [[Search engines]] can be utilized to locate sites like this for whatever class of tools one may be interested in.  == Tool Collecting Categories == Categories of tools range from the broad - planes, rules, braces, hammers, etc. to the specific - planes made by the Gage Company of Vineland, New Jersey for example. People who are new to the hobby, should know that there are many good modern reference books that will guide you in your search, as well as many reprints of the catalogs in which these tools were originally offered. It is necessary to learn the differences between various tools, their history and the history of their makers. Often tools will exhibit differences contrasting the different locations of their makers, or different features contrasting different time periods.  The following are some ways to begin collecting tools:   * Tools of a specific company or maker - for example, L. Bailey Victor tools, Seneca Falls Tool Company tools, Miller's Falls tools, Disston Saws, Chelor planes, etc.  * Tools of a specific type - hammers, braces, axes, saws, patented planes, transitional planes, treadle-powered machines, etc.  * Tools of a specific period - tools from 1850-1900, post WWII era tools, etc.  * Tools from a specific place - Scottish tools, tools from Massachusetts makers, etc.  * Tools of a specific occupation - cooper's tools, machinist tools, watchmaker's tools, garden tools.  * A combination of one or more of the above categories -- for example, one each of a specific type of Stanley tool, i.e. all Stanley saws, all Stanley marking gauges, all Stanley planes, etc. * A &quot;type study&quot; of one specific model, for example, a type study of Stanley #6 jointer planes or Norris A5 smooth planes. * Tools that show how a specific idea progressed over time, for example tools tracing the development of the plane's adjusting mechanisms, or tools showing how an early patent was bought out and developed by another company.  * Tool advertising and catalogs.  ==See also== * [[Cutting tool]] * [[Diamond tool]] * [[Garden tool]] * [[Hand tool]] * [[Power tool]] * [[Tool]]  ==External links== *[http://www.finetools.com Catalogue of American Patented Antique Tools].

The theatre company focuses primarily on plays from the Shakespeare canon, but its seasons include works by other classic playwrights such as Euripides, Henrik Ibsen and Oscar Wilde. It is a member of the [[League of Resident Theatres]].  The [[Wall Street Journal]] has heralded the company as &quot;the nation's foremost [[Shakespeare]] company&quot;. [http://www.theatermania.com/content/theater.cfm/int_show_id/122329]  Artistic Director [[Michael Kahn (theatre director)|Michael Kahn]] took over what was originally The Shakespeare Theatre at the Folger (part of the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]]) during the 1986-7 season.  Under the name The Shakespeare Theatre, the troupe moved in 1992 to the newly built 451-seat Lansburgh Theatre, its current location, at 450 7th Street NW, Washington, D.C. in the [[Penn Quarter, Washington, D.C.|Penn Quarter]], with administrative offices and rehearsal studios across town on [[Capitol Hill]]. At the start of the 2005-6 season, the present name, Shakespeare Theatre Company, was adopted. It constructed a second nearby theatre named [[Sidney Harman Hall]], which opened on September 15, 2007.  Sidney Harman Hall joined the Lansburgh Theatre in becoming the [[Harman Center for the Arts]]. The Harman Center, named for philanthropist [[Sidney Harman]], will expand theatrical opportunities not just for the Shakespeare Theatre Company but also for other performance groups as well.  In addition to a troupe of regular and frequently appearing actors, Kahn brings acclaimed guest performers and directors each season. The Company also offers a number of educational opportunities, including its Academy for Classical Acting, a one-year Master of Fine Arts graduate program, and school and community programs such as Text Alive! and Students for Shakespeare.  In 1991, the Shakespeare Theatre Company began its annual [[Shakespeare Theatre Company Free For All|Free For All]] productions at the Carter Barron Amphitheatre in D.C.'s [[Rock Creek Park]]. Each summer the company remounts a production from the previous season at the Amphitheatre. These free performances attract D.C.-area residents of all backgrounds and income levels.  In August 2006, the Shakespeare Theatre Company took its production of ''Love’s Labor’s Lost'' to [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] in England to participate in the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]’s [[Complete Works Festival]]. From January to June 30, 2007 The Shakespeare Theatre co-hosted the International [[Shakespeare in Washington Festival]].  Over the past 20 years, the Shakespeare Theatre Company has won 55 [[Helen Hayes Award]]s for acting, directing and technical achievements.

Rush was born on [[January 26]] and grew up in the north end of [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington]]. As a child, she studied classical piano for 10 years.  In 1960, she auditioned for a band (directed by her first husband) that played [[sock hop]]s. Next, she was part of Merrilee and Her Men, doing covers of male pop hits. Then she joined a Seattle rhythm and blues group called Tiny Tony and the Statics.   Merrilee and the Turnabouts was formed in 1965. One of the group's roadies worked for [[Paul Revere and the Raiders]], who were doing a tour in the South in 1967 and invited Merrilee to be their opening act.  Merrilee's rendition of &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; was recorded in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], in early 1968 and was produced by [[Chips Moman]] and the late [[Tommy Cogbill]]. Released by [[Bell Records (1950s-70s)|Bell Records]], it climbed to #7 in the US charts that year, and reportedly reached No. 1 in seven countries. The song garnered Rush a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] Nomination for Female Vocalist of the Year. She was nominated alongside Grammy royalty in [[Barbra Streisand]] (&quot;[[Barbra Streisand discography#Singles|Funny Girl]]&quot;), [[Dionne Warwick]] (&quot;[[Do You Know the Way to San Jose]]&quot;), [[Aretha Franklin]] (&quot;[[I Say a Little Prayer]]&quot;), and [[Mary Hopkin]] (&quot;[[Those Were the Days (song)|Those Were the Days]]&quot;).  She appeared on numerous television shows in the 1960s and 1970s, including ''[[American Bandstand]]'', ''[[The Joey Bishop Show]]'','' Happening'', ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'', ''[[The Everly Brothers Show]]'', ''Something Else'' hosted by John Byner, and many more.  &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; was written by [[Chip Taylor]] (born James Wesley Voight, younger brother of actor [[Jon Voight]] and uncle to actress [[Angelina Jolie]]), who also wrote &quot;Wild Thing&quot;, a hit for [[The Troggs]] in 1966, and &quot;I Can't Let Go&quot;, a hit for [[The Hollies]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].  Rush's recording of &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; was featured prominently in the film ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]'' for which Jolie won an Academy Award. &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; has also been featured in the major motion pictures ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'' and ''[[Fingers (1978 film)|Fingers]]'' starring [[Harvey Keitel]]. Many singers have covered the song, but only the 1981 remake by American pop singer [[Juice Newton]] exceeded Rush's version in popularity.  In 1971, Merrilee signed with [[Scepter Records]] and released one single, a cover of [[Carole King]] song &quot;Child Of Mine&quot;. While that was Merrilee's lone release on Scepter, she cut several tracks for the label including a femme version of the [[Billy Joel]] classic &quot;She's Got A Way&quot; (He's Got A Way). In 1976, Merrilee would sign with [[United Artists Records]]. While at U/A she released three singles, &quot;Could It Be Love I Found Tonight&quot;, &quot;Save Me&quot;, and &quot;Rainstorm&quot;. Her self-titled album for the label was released in 1977.  Merrilee now lives in the countryside near Seattle, in a century-old farm house built by her grandfather. She continues to perform with her own band and in Rock and Roll nostalgia shows across the country. She is married to singer-songwriter and entertainer [[Billy Mac]] and together they have a successful Old English Sheepdog-breeding business.  In 1989 the [[Northwest Area Musicians' Association]] honored Rush with induction into the NAMA Hall of Fame.  In [[2003]] she appeared as herself in the PBS special &quot;At the Drive-In&quot; along with [[Jan Berry]] and [[Dean Torrence]] (of [[Jan and Dean]]), [[Fabian (entertainer)|Fabian]], [[Bobby Vee]], [[Chris Montez]], [[Matthew Nelson]] and [[Gunnar Nelson]] (sons of [[Rick Nelson]]), [[Dodie Stevens]] and others.  Merrilee Rush's &quot;Angel Of The Morning&quot; album has been reissued on compact disc via the [[Collector's Choice Music]] label. The reissue includes the entire original 1968 LP, featuring the Top Ten title track and the follow-up single &quot;[[That Kind of Woman]]&quot; as well as nine non-LP singles and B-sides as bonus tracks. The bonus tracks include a psychedelic version of the Four Tops' &quot;[[Reach Out]]&quot; (an AGP label single release that reached #79 on the Billboard Hot 100), and a cover of [[Burt Bacharach]]'s classic &quot;[[What the World Needs Now]]&quot;, which was produced by [[Quincy Jones]] for the soundtrack album to the film ''[[Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice]]''.  The &quot;Angel Of The Morning&quot; sessions were recorded at Chips Moman's American Studio in Memphis and featured the same musicians who played on Elvis Presley's famous Memphis recordings.   2008 will mark the 40th Anniversary of the release of the Merrilee Rush ''Angel Of The Morning'' single and album.  == External links == * [http://www.merrileerush.com/ Merrilee Rush official site] * [http://www.billymac.com/ Billy Mac official site] * [http://www.classicbands.com/MerrileeRushInterview.html Gary James interview] * [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421649 IMDB's &quot;At the Drive-In&quot; entry]  {{DEFAULTSORT:Rush, Merrilee}} [[Category:Washington musicians]] [[Category:People from Seattle, Washington|Rush, Merrilee]] [[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)|Rush, Merrilee]] [[Category:Living people]]</text>     </revision>

Gaither is most notable for her membership in the recurring cast of comedians on sketch comedy series ''[[MADtv]]''.   ==Early life== Daniele Gaither was born in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]. As a child, Gaither was always the class clown with a knack for storytelling and mimicry. Like her fellow ''MADtv'' castmates [[Nicole Sullivan]] and [[Josh Meyers]], she attended [[Northwestern University]] at [[Evanston, Illinois]]. In 1993, she moved to [[Los Angeles]] to pursue an acting career, and attend the [[The Groundlings|Groundlings School]], where aspiring sketch and improv performers are given a systematic approach to learning improvisation and writing skills.   While she studied at the Groundlings school, Gaither was trained by [[Michael McDonald (actor)|Michael McDonald]], before his tenure on ''MADtv''. She completed the school and became a member of The Groundlings on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood.  After several years as a member, she left the group in 2006.  In her comedy, Gaither tries to &quot;represent people that you see in the streets and know in everyday life,&quot; and sometimes uses her family experiences as material. She does impressions of people that she grew up admiring, such as [[Patti Labelle]], [[Marla Gibbs]] and [[Isabel Sanford]], but also does impressions of current celebrities like [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Star Jones]] and [[Lil Kim]].   Gaither's first regular television appearance was on ''[[Hype (TV series)|Hype]]'' in 2000. After her first big break, she appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Rerun Show]]''. Gaither has a recurring role as Chandra the hairdresser on [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Reno 911!]]''.  ==''MADtv''== Gaither first appeared in an episode of ''MADtv'''s second season, which featured [[Hip hop music|rap]] star [[Ice T]]. The skit was concerned a mock debate between [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] (played by [[Bryan Callen]]) and [[U.S. Senator]] [[Bob Dole]] (played by [[David Herman]]) who transformed himself into a &quot;twisted&quot; version of the 1970s [[blaxploitation]] icon [[Dolemite]]. Gaither played one of Dole's &quot;Dolemite girls.&quot;   [[Image:Eve 1 .jpg|thumb|Daniele Gaither as rap star [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]]]]  Gaither officially joined the cast of ''MADtv'' in 2003, seven years after her initial appearance on the series, as a feature performer for the ninth season. She became the second [[African American]] female cast member in the show's history, when she replaced [[Debra Wilson]]. Gaither was later promoted to a repertory performer status the following season. Some of her characters were only seen one time on the discussion show ''[[Real Mother****ing Talk]]''. Outside of that, some of her best characters included senior citizen Dilly Mae Jackson, ''Taco Hell'' boss Loretta, and Yvoone Criddle, a middle aged woman who openly acknowledges her own [[sociopath]]ic behavior yet simultaneously appears to be oblivious to its perversity.  Gaither portrayed offbeat impersonations of celebrities, which included [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Alani Vasquez|La La]], and [[Tyra Banks]].  Gaither was released from ''MADtv'' by FOX in June 2006.   ===Characters=== * Dellie Mae Jackson (''7 A.M.

He was famed for his frugality with both private and public funds, and was nicknamed &quot;'''Blue Jeans Bill'''&quot; for his humble style of dress.  ==Biography== James Douglas Williams was born on [[January 16]], [[1808]] in [[Pickaway County, Ohio]]. He moved with his family to [[Knox County, Indiana]] at the age of 10, and settled near [[Vincennes, Indiana]] where he remained much of the rest of his life. He received little schooling, but did occasionally attend the log schoolhouse near his home.&lt;ref&gt;Woollen, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Williams' father died in 1828, and being the oldest son, Williams became the caretaker of his family, continuing to run his fathers farm. In 1831 Williams married Nancy Huffman, and together they had seven children. With Williams regularly in the public service, she ran the family farm for much of her life. She suffered a fall in January, 1880 and died on June 27, 1880.&lt;ref name = w148&gt;Woollen, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;  ===Public career===  In 1839 Williams first entered public service serving as [[justice of the peace]] of [[Vincennes, Indiana]] until he resigned in 1843. The same year he was elected to the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] and remained in the General Assembly until 1874, serving in both houses.&lt;ref name = w148/&gt; Williams was responsible for the authorship of many bills, including laws that permitted widows to inherit the estate of their husbands. He wrote the bill that established the state's first sinking fund. He also encouraged the development of the State Board of Agriculture and served as a member for sixteen years, during which time he accumulated a large estate of lands.&lt;ref name  = w149&gt;Woollen, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; William became known for his frugality with both public and private money. He never purchased expensive clothing but instead choose to wear homespun clothes and denim, earning him the nick name &quot;Blue Jeans Bill&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Woollen, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[American Civil War]] Williams' was accused of being a [[copperhead (political)|Copperhead]] when he attempted to interfere with the war effort and submitted legislation to require Governor [[Oliver Morton]] to show what the money in the state emergency fund was being spent on.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1872 he was the Democratic candidate for the [[United States Senate]], but was defeated by [[Oliver Morton]]. Williams was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] from Indiana in 1874 and served from 1875 to 1876. During this time he served as chairman of the committee on accounts and was responsible for considerable reform, and significant saving by cutting business costs. While still in Washington he was informed that his party had nominated him to run for governor, and nomination he was not a candidate for. Instead of declining, he decided to not seek reelection to Congress, but instead returned to Indiana to campaign for governor.&lt;ref name  = w149/&gt;  ===Governor===  Williams was elected governor of Indiana in 1876, defeating future [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Benjamin Harrison]] in a close election, winning by about 5,000 votes. Williams became the only farmer to be elected [[Governor of Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Woollen, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; He was inaugurated on [[January 9]], [[1877]]. During his administration he sought and acquired funds to being the construction of a new state capitol building. He sought to run the government with economy but sought increased funding for the state assistance programs to the war veterans.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p.184&lt;/ref&gt;  He was instrumental in finding the funds for Purdue University and was a &quot;women's rights&quot; activist before such a thing was even known  championing the right for women to own property. He fought for budegetary constraint and was known for his thrifty management of the house's budgetary committee.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in late October 1880, Williams developed a [[kidney infection]]. His health steadily deteriorated and he died shortly before the ends of his term as governor in Indianapolis, on November 20, 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Woollen, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; James Douglas &quot;Blue Jeans&quot; Williams is buried in a rural [[Monroe City, Indiana]] cemetery on ground he donated to establish Walnut Grove Methodist Church near his home.  His family purchased a large obelisk for his grave which was unveiled on July 4, 1883, and it still stands above the tiny Bedford Stone church in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Woollen, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the members of the church are Williams descendants.  == Obituary== The following is Governor Williams obituary in the [[New York Times]].[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E01E0DF123FEE3ABC4951DFB767838B699FDE]  Gov. Williams Dead. The Home-Life and Public Services Of Indiana's Governor. Indianapolis, Indiana Nov. 20- The illness from which Gov. Williams has been suffering for nearly three weeks terminated fatally at 12:30 o'clock today.  Such a result has not been anticipated until within the past 48 hours and even then it was the opinion of his physicians that he might live several days, if not weeks.  For 15 years the Governor has been subject to bladder inflammation, and it was this, aggravated by malarial fever, that caused his death.  He died in the room he has occupied since his incumbency, the Executive office in the Washington Clubhouse, there being with him his physician, the nurse the wife of the janitor of the building, and Judge Scott, of the Supreme Court, and his son, John Williams, who arrived at midnight from Wheatland, Knox County.  the Governor's only other child, Mrs. Eliza Dunn, a widow, was compelled to remain at the homestead, near Wheatland, by sickness.  The Governor's death was very peaceful.  For 12 hours he had been unconscious and he did not rouse at all, but passed away without a word or a muscular quiver.   James Douglas Williams was born in Pickaway County, Ohio, Jan. 16, 1808.  His parents were Virginians.  His grandfather was from Scotland, coming to this country in the middle of the eighteenth century and locating on the James River.  George Williams, the Governor's father, settled in Ohio in an early day in the history of that State and thence removed to Knox County, Indiana where the family home has been ever since.  The Governor's father died in 1828 , leaving him the eldest of a family of six children.  He remained with his mother on the farm until he was 21 years old, when he married Nancy Huffman, the daughter of a neighbor, and the two began a life in a rough location on a quarter section of wild land.  As the result of their work, the Governor leaves probably the finest farm home in Indiana.  His estate, compromising over {{convert|2000|acre|km2}}, is in splendid cultivation, and with comfortable, generous improvements.   Mrs. Williams died a few months ago from the effects of a fall, and five of seven children are also buried on the homestead.  His wife's death greatly affected the Governor.  His associates have noticed a great change in his manner, but never a word of complaint or repining from his lips.  At the old home, a room was always kept for his use, fitted up with a broad fireplace and the furniture to which he had been accustomed to in early life.  At one of his windows, his wife always sat to welcome him on his return home.  Since her death he has not cared to return to the scene of his loss.  He went occasionally, but it was always a trial.  Recently, his daughter missed him from his usual place, and after a long search he was found in the barn, his grief welling up in great sobs that shook his frame.  His domestic life was a happy, homely, modest one.   His public life began in 1839 by election to the office of Justice of the Peace.  In 1841 he was elected to the lower house of the State Legislature by 90 majority, though the county was strongly Whig.  Defeated in 1843, he was elected in 1845, and successively until, in 1858, he was elected to the State Senate, and kept there almost continuously until 1874.  In 1872 he was the caucus nominee of his party for United States Senator to succeed Senator Morton.  In 1874 he was elected Representative from the Second Congressional District to succeed the present Supreme Court Judge Niblack.  At the expiration of his term he came home to take the candidacy of his party for Governor, in 1876 - he having been nominated as a compromise between Franklin Landers and William S. Holman, between whom the convention of 1876 was divided.  He canvassed the State, accompanied by Senator Vorhees and was elected over General Benjamin Harrison by a plurality of 5,500 votes.  The Governor wore a suit of blue jeans, the yarn for which was spun by his wife.  From this fact he was called &quot;Blue Jeans&quot; Williams.&quot;  This habit he kept up until within a short time when he bought a suit of clothes of another color and texture.  For 16 years he was a member of the State Board of Agriculture, and for 4 years was its President.  He was the devoted friend of the common school system of the State in the earlier years of its development, and assisted Gov. Whitcomb and Gov. Wright in laying the foundation for our present splendid school fund.  Probably no man in Indiana was better versed in State legislation, as no man has ever served so long a time in its General Assembly.   Governor Williams was 6 feet, 4 inches in stature, of spare build, weighing only 170 pounds. His personal appearance was such that he was called the Abraham Lincoln of Indiana.  His angular features and ungainly figure, clad in his homespun jeans, made him a curious spectacle.  He was rugged in his virtues, simple in his tastes, Spartan in his honesty, and although uneducated and unpolished, he served the State to the best of his ability, was a pure upright man in all private relations and commanded the respect and confidence of all the people.  His last public appearance was three weeks ago tonight at the dedication of the new dining hall of the House of Refuge at Plainfield.  He took to his bed on the evening of the Presidential election day, Nov. 2.   A meeting of citizens was held tonight attended by prominent men of all parties.  Senator McDonald presided and Secretary of State Shanklin acted as Secretary.  Committees were appointed to arrange for the funeral of Gov. Williams.  The Committee on Memorial is headed by United States Judge Gresham and is to report to a meeting to be held Monday morning at 9 o'clock.  The body will lie in state at the Courthouse from 11 o'clock Monday morning until 5 in the evening.  On Tuesday it will be taken to Vincennes and lie in state 3 hours and be then taken to Wheatland for interment.  Mayor Caven has issued a proclamation asking for the suspension of business between 11 and 12 o'clock Monday morning and 5 and 6 in the afternoon during which hours the body will be moving from the clubhouse to the Courthouse.  A committee consisting of Senator McDonald and General Harrison was appointed to invite the President and Cabinet members of Congress and Governors of adjacent States to attend the funeral.  Telegraphic invitations went forward tonight.  The pall bearers will be ex Govs Hendricks and Baker, Messrs. English and Landers, Gov. Gray, Mayor Caven, Judge Niblack, Gen. Manson, State House Commissioners Nelson and Morris, W.R. McKeen of Terre Haute, and Judge Scott of the Supreme Court.   Columbus, Ohio, Nov 20 - The flags on the State house here are at half mast as a token of respect to the late Gov. Williams of Indiana.   from The New York Times.

'''Leonardo Dati''' (1360&amp;ndash;[[16 march]] [[1425]]) was an Italian friar and humanist. He was [[Master general of the Dominican Order]] from 1414 to his death.  He was a Prior of [[Santa Maria Novella]] from 1401, and took part in the [[Council of Pisa]] of 1409. At the time of the [[Council of Constance]], Dati became Master General of a reunited [[Dominican Order]]. His sermons at [[Pisa]] and [[Constance]] include references to literary texts, and he was well known as an author of commentaries on [[Aristotle]]. Leonardo also gave financial aid to his brother Gregorio [or Goro], a Florentine merchant and diarist.  Both Leonardo and Gregorio Dati are attributed authorship of ''[[La sfera]]'' (The sphere), an astronomical-geographic ''[[Ottava rima|poemetto in ottave]]'', written in the second half of 14th century, and a work much popular in its time. This work in verse gives information about the world, the marinaresche compass and other things, adding observations, notes about travel and designs. In some manuscripts of ''La sfera'' there are designs representing ports, headlands, islands, linked by many lines.  Dati's sermons on the feast of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] (October 1416) and the feast of the [[Circumcision of Jesus]] (January 1417) advocated respect for [[Papal supremacy|papal power]] and reform within the context of the established order. The earlier sermon touched off an exchange of polemical memoranda between Dati and supporters of [[Conciliarism|conciliar supremacy]]. Dati then addressed issues raised in this exchange in the later sermon. Dati's discussion of [[circumcision]] was traditional for his time, describing the [[Brit milah|jewish rite]] as superseded by [[baptism]].  He is buried in the Cappella Rucellai at Santa Maria Novella.  His tombstone is attributed to [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]].  ==External links== * [http://www-db2.helsinki.fi/muisti/muisti.muisti_haku.tulos_sivu?pp_kieli=e&amp;sivuno=0&amp;haetaan_lkm=K&amp;v_no=0&amp;p_tekija=Dati,_Leonardo&amp;p_nimeke=&amp;p_asia= The manuscript of &quot;La sfera&quot; (or &quot;La Sphera&quot;) is a description of the world in poetic form.]  * Thomas M.

His nickname is &quot;Vasa Vasa&quot; [Kiss Kiss] for his tendency to kiss all and sundry - he claims that he has kissed a quarter of all the people on the island.&lt;ref name=ind300506/&gt;  ==Biography== ===Christian Democrat=== A graduate of [[Medicine]] and [[Surgery]] at the [[University of Palermo]], with a specialization in [[radiology]], Cuffaro joined the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] (DC) party during his student days. Then, after having served as City Councillor in his native city, [[Raffadali]], and [[Palermo]], Cuffaro was first elected Member of the [[Sicilian Regional Assembly]] in 1991; in 1996 he served as Regional Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.  His political career began under the wing of former minister [[Calogero Mannino]], who in the past was suspected of having ties with the Mafia. Following the demise of the DC, he became a member of ex-DC splinter parties before joining the party [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] (UDC). He first became known nationally in September 1991, when he defended his political patron Mannino, accused of being a witness at a Mafia wedding, live on television in a joint broadcasting of the [[Maurizio Costanzo]] show and [[Michele Santoro]]’s [[Samarcanda]], accusing the presenters that their journalism was Mafia journalism. In the presence of Antimafia judge [[Giovanni Falcone]] he accused the Sicilian prosecutors of manipulating state witnesses ([[pentito|pentiti]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5MZmJLMQ9Y Costanzo Show: Totò Cuffaro aggredisce Giovanni Falcone], You Tube&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001, after having joined the UDC, Cuffaro was endorsed by the [[House of Freedoms]] as presidential candidate for Sicily. He won the election, with 59.1% of the vote, defeating [[Leoluca Orlando]].

Guttadauro learned that his home was being &quot;bugged&quot; from another doctor. The colleague alleged that he, in turn, had been tipped off by Cuffaro. Guttadauro was recorded describing how the Mafia had funded Cuffaro's 2001 election campaign. According to a transcript, he told that Cuffaro was handed packages of cash &quot;in the least elegant, but most tangible way possible&quot;.&lt;ref name=&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/italy/story/0,12576,1296495,00.html Sicilian governor on mafia charge], The Guardian, September 3, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  On [[January 18]], [[2008]], Cuffaro was found guilty of having helped the Mafia and was given a five-year sentence, during which time he will be suspended from all public offices. Cuffaro was not found guilty of outright collusion with Cosa Nostra but the court concluded he acted in favour of several people sentenced for Mafia crimes and committed breaches of confidentiality. By Italian law, both the sentence and suspension from public office can only begin after the automatic appeals process is concluded. The prosecution had asked that Cuffaro be given an eight-year sentence but judges concluded that while he had helped the Mafia, there had been neither conspiracy nor willful intent. He has denied all wrongdoing and refused to step down, despite that he has also been banned from public office. &quot;I knew I didn't do anything to willfully help the Mafia and tomorrow morning I intend to be back at my desk,&quot; Cuffaro said after the court adjourned.&lt;ref name=ansa180108&gt;[http://www.ansa.it/site/notizie/awnplus/english/news/2008-01-18_118173820.html Sicilian governor gets five years: Salvatore Cuffaro found guilty of helping the Mafia], ANSA, January 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rep180108&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.repubblica.it/2007/10/sezioni/cronaca/cuffaro-processo/cuffaro-sentenza/cuffaro-sentenza.html Mafia, Cuffaro condannato a 5 anni], La Repubblica, January 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc180108&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7197334.stm Sicily chief guilty in Mafia case], BBC News, January 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The day after, Cuffaro handed out [[cannoli]], a Sicilian pastry, as if he was celebrating the sentence that he considered positive because he was not convicted for ties to the Mafia or formally accused of being in cahoots with Cosa Nostra.

His resignation followed reports that the national government was planning a move to oust him. The announcement represents a reversal for Cuffaro, who earlier said he would hang on to his post and appeal his five-year prison sentence of January 18. Many, including some politicians from allied parties, were angry that he celebrated not being convicted of a more serious accusation - helping the Mafia as an organization. The head of Italy's politically influential industrial lobby, [[Confindustria]], lamented that Cuffaro remained in office while Sicilian businessmen were defying the Mafia by increasingly refusing to pay systematic &quot;protection&quot; money. A widely published photo of him offering his aides a tray of cannoli pastries to celebrate fuelled the outrage.&lt;ref name=rep260108b&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.repubblica.it/2007/10/sezioni/cronaca/cuffaro-processo/dimesso-cuffaro/dimesso-cuffaro.html Cuffaro si è dimesso da Governatore], La Repubblica, January 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iht260108&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/01/26/news/Italy-Mafia-Politician.php Sicily's governor resigns after conviction in Mafia case], International Herald Tribune, January 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==External links== *{{it icon}} [http://www.totocuffaro.it/ Official website]  *{{it icon}} [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYLic2Raqa4 Intercettazione ambientale: Boss Guttadauro parla di Cuffaro] from La Mafia è Bianca on YouTube *{{it icon}} [http://www.antimafiaduemila.com/content/view/1644/78/ Cosi il boss scoprì la &quot;cimice&quot;], Antimafia Duemila, December 2007  {{ItalyRegionPresidents}} {{SicilianPres}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Cuffaro, Salvatore}} [[Category:1958 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Politicians of Sicily]] [[Category:Members of Union of Christian Democrats]] [[Category:Associates of the Sicilian Mafia]] [[Category:Convicted Italian MPs]]  [[fr:Salvatore Cuffaro]] [[it:Salvatore Cuffaro]] [[pt:Salvatore Cuffaro]] [[scn:Salvatore Cuffaro]]</text>     </revision>

The C8 spyder T has a more powerful Audi 4.2 litre V8 twin turbo with {{Convert|525|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} giving it a top speed of {{Auto km/h|320|0}}. The C8 Laviolette has the {{Convert|400|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} Audi engine but unlike the spyder models that come with either a soft or a hard top, the Laviolette has a glass canopy. The C8 Double 12R is a version made specifically for the [[24 hours of Le Mans]] also using the Audi V8 engine with {{Convert|480|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and the C8 Double 12S is the street version of this car which has the same glass canopy of the Laviolette and optionally has a {{Convert|600|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} engine instead of the {{Convert|400|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} engine from the C8 spyder, giving it a top speed between {{Auto km/h|300|0}} and {{Auto km/h|345|0}} depending on the engine. Both Double 12 versions have a modified C8 spyder frame with a longer wheelbase and a bigger fuel tank, 100 litres instead of 75.  The GT2R is the latest racing model of the car and has {{Convert|450|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and an open top with a metal [[rollcage]]. The Spyker C12 LaTurbie is the most recent road model and also has a long wheelbase but comes with a new 12 cylinder 6.0 litre Audi [[W12 engine]] producing {{Convert|500|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}}. Despite the changed designation, C12 instead of C8, the car's appearance is still similar to that of the C8 models. C12 refers to the twelve cylinders, while the C8 has only eight.  Though similar in name to the C12 LaTurbie, the limited edition [[Spyker C12 Zagato]] is different from the the C8 series.  ==Racing== [[Image:Spyker C8 Spyder GT2R.jpg|thumb|right|One of two C8 Spyder GT2-Rs at the [[2006 24 Hours of Le Mans]].]] The Spyder C8 Double 12R's first race was the [[12 Hours of Sebring]] in 2002, though an accident prevented the car from finishing.

It was hosted by [[Chris Hardwick]].  ==Premise== Two teams competed in a studio literally filled with junk to answer questions based on music videos and pop culture. Each team brought six &quot;prized possessions&quot; from home to risk having destroyed, or &quot;Trashed&quot;, if they did not answer enough questions correctly.  ==Main Game== To start the game, host Hardwick would ask the teams a toss-up question (no points at stake) to determine who would go first. This team then selected a &quot;prized possession&quot; from the other team that they wanted to see &quot;trashed&quot;. After the selection was made, a category (similar to those on ''[[Remote Control (game show)|Remote Control]]'') was given. Three questions, worth 50 points each, were asked; either team could buzz in and answer the question. The defending team had to answer at least two of the three questions correctly to save their object. If they did not, the possession in play was destroyed in front of them violently. (Note that once the fate of the object had been decided, the category was over immediately.) If an object was saved, it could not be chosen again. Each team played with three out of their six possessions per round.  Whether an object was saved or &quot;trashed&quot;, the team who answered the most questions correctly in a set got to select the next item they wanted to see &quot;trashed&quot;. Round two was the same as round one, with the point values being doubled and each team's other three items put into play.  ===Categories=== Each category consisted of three questions dealing with [[pop culture]], [[music video]]s, or random trivia. On occasion, a [[Sketch comedy|skit]] would be presented, after which the contestants would have to answer questions about the skit or from the performers themselves. Examples of categories included &quot;The Naked Trucker&quot; and &quot;Where in the Hell is [[Mayim Bialik]]?&quot; (a satire of the computer game/game show, ''[[Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?]]'')  ===Trashing=== The demolition of prized possessions was carried out by Mark Fite, AKA &quot;Mark the Trasher&quot;, with occasional help from Andrea Wagner, the model/announcer. Depending on the item being destroyed, this could be carried out in many ways: * Blowing the item up inside a blast chamber * Shooting the item with a [[paintball]] gun * Stuffed animals, shoes, and the like were run over with a lawn mower. * The possession was placed against a brick wall, then a [[wrecking ball]] would be sent crashing into the object. * [[Electronics]], such as VCR's and boomboxes, were crushed in a device that looked like a vertical vise with spikes. An autographed basketball was also destroyed with this machine. * Mark would appear to be working out on a [[leg press]] machine; he would extend a full rep and the item was placed underneath the suspended weight stack. He would then remove his legs, allowing the weights to freefall and crush the object. * Shoes and boots were destroyed by placing them on a [[mannequin]] sitting in a shoe shine booth; the boots were then &quot;shined&quot; using a sander, destroying them. * Clothes were destroyed by cutting them up with scissors or a knife, or swinging them around on a [[chainsaw]]; on one occasion, a shirt was placed on a giant doll of [[Beavis and Butt-Head|Beavis or Butt-Head]] (clearly to promote that show, which was just starting out and becoming popular.) Mark then proceeded to pour bleach on both Beavis and Butt-Head, ruining the shirt; it was then sliced apart with a knife. * [[Baseball cards]] and [[compact disc|CD's]] were destroyed by placing them in a box filled with sand, then running over them with a belt sander, ruining both sides. * [[Televisions]] and [[cassette tape]] collections were often destroyed by throwing heavy objects onto them from a balcony constructed on stage. * [[Surfboard]]s were sawn into pieces with a chainsaw. * If at any time the &quot;trashing&quot; did not work as planned, Mark the Trasher would simply finish the job himself using a [[sledgehammer]]. * On one occasion, the item at stake was an autographed [[baseball]]; they brought out a paint can full of hot tar in which to submerge it. However, Mark decided that the baseball was too expensive and instead threw it into the audience. * On another occasion, a male contestant with long blonde hair put his hair on the line as one of his &quot;prized possessions&quot;; upon getting these questions wrong, staff members began cutting his hair and continued to do so for the remainder of the main game.  ==Lightning Round== Round three was called the &quot;Survival Round&quot;. One contestant from each team had to answer questions (at 150 points each) while the other contestant was &quot;imprisoned&quot;. At the end of 39 seconds (not a typo), the team in the lead won the game. The &quot;imprisoned&quot; contestant on the losing team was then &quot;trashed&quot; him/herself (either [[Public humiliation|publicly humiliated]], [[slime]]d, or made to come face to face with their &quot;worst fear&quot;.) The winners moved on to the final round, while the losers left with a tacky parting gift such as a [[Simpsons]] [[chess|chess set]] and were also required to do 10 hours [[community service]] (to go with the &quot;trash&quot; theme.)  ==Bonus Round== The bonus round was a cross between the one used on ''Remote Control'' and the Winner's Circle round on the ''[[Pyramid (game show)|$25,000 Pyramid]]''. The players on the winning team were seated face to face, with three television monitors behind each player, each showing a music video. One at a time, one player would tell the other what was showing on one of the videos behind them, and the second player would have to identify the artist of said video. Correctly identifying all six videos/artists within the time limit won the grand prize.  The time given in the bonus round depended on how well the team did in the upfront game; 30 seconds were given with an additional five seconds tacked on for every possession that team saved; hence, saving all six possessions resulted in the team having 60 seconds to identify all the videos (Hardwick's usual explanation for this situation was, &quot;Normally, we give you 30 seconds, but you saved everything, so I'm going to give you full time&quot; (or something similar), after which he would ask for the timer to be set to 60 seconds).  ==Ongoing gags/jokes== ''Trashed'' had several ongoing comedy bits that were emphasized, usually involving the trash theme and/or humiliating the contestants. * The word &quot;Loser&quot; was used excessively in this show. At the end of the game, before the &quot;consolation prizes&quot; and winners' prizes were announced, host Hardwick would usually say something to the effect of &quot;on Trashed, there are no winners, just losers!&quot; A sound bite saying &quot;Loser!&quot; was sometimes used when a contestant got a question wrong; the word was also displayed on a screen during the bonus round if one contestant gave an invalid clue. The connotation was furthered with the [[Beck]] song [[Loser (song)|Loser]], which was popular at the time. * The questions very often included bathroom or sexual humor; this is commonplace for MTV, but some of it was very clearly meant to test the boundaries of acceptable material on the network. This pushing of the envelope may go hand-in-hand with the experimenting with crudeness done on other relatively new MTV shows at the time, most notably ''Beavis and Butt-Head.'' * Before the bonus round was played, the &quot;rules&quot; to the bonus round and a disclaimer were read at an incomprehensibly fast speed by the announcer as they scrolled rapidly across the screen. * If a team won the bonus round, Mark the Trasher would shoot [[confetti]] onto the contestants through a modified [[leafblower]] from the balcony; later in the season, he would begin shooting random objects such as regular pieces of paper through the leafblower, and finally this would occur whether the team won or lost. * Songs played in the background while the end credits rolled included [[What Is Love (song)|What Is Love]] by [[Haddaway]], and [[Mr. Vain]] by [[Culture Beat]]. These songs were popular in 1994 and usually had a connotation of someone hurting someone else, further emphasizing the destructive nature of the show.  ==Additional Notes== * ''Trashed'' is one of the earliest of several game shows that has employed destruction of prizes and/or property as one of its gimmicks. Other such shows have included ''[[Big Deal (game show)|Big Deal]]'', a knockoff of the classic show ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' in which certain deals involved contestants damaging and/or destroying their own possessions in an effort to win better prizes; ''[[I Bet You Will]]'', another MTV program in which random people were selected off the streets or other public venues to perform outrageous stunts and/or have their possessions destroyed for money; ''[[Distraction (game show)|Distraction]]'', a British show later also produced for [[Comedy Central]] in which contestants were humiliated and distracted while answering questions, with the winner having to save his or her prizes from damage and/or destruction; and ''[[Beat the Crusher]]'', another British game show in which contestants had their prized possessions destroyed as a tradeoff for money and/or punishment for losing games, with the final competition involving two couples gambling their cars in an attempt to win another one (the loser's car was dropped into a [[compactor|junkyard crusher]] and smashed.)  ==External links== * {{imdb title|id=0189316|title=Trashed}} * [http://www.prehensile.com/tales/trashed/trashed.htm One contestant's experience]  [[Category:1990s American television series]] [[Category:Cable game shows]] [[Category:MTV game shows]] [[Category:1994 television series debuts]] [[Category:1995 television series endings]]</text>     </revision>

Most people in the [[Eskimo]] population are M/M, while this genotype is rare among [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]]. In fact, they tend to possess the opposite genotype (N/N).  The MN blood group system is under the control of an [[autosomal]] locus found on chromosome 4 out of 23, with two alleles designated LM and LN. The bloodtype is due to a [[glycoprotein]] present on the surface of red blood cells, which behaves as a native [[antigen]]. [[Phenotypic]] expression at this locus is [[codominant]] because an individual may exhibit either one or both antigenic substances. Frequencies of the two [[alleles]] vary widely among human populations.

Its transmitter is located north of [[Fort Myers Shores, Florida|Fort Myers Shores]] near the [[Lee County, Florida|Lee]] and [[Charlotte County, Florida|Charlotte]] County line. Owned by Sun Broadcasting, the station is located on [[Comcast]] channel 6 hence the ''''''CW 6''''' branding. [[Broadcast syndication|Syndicated]] programming on the station includes: ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', ''[[King of Queens]]'', ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Judge Judy]]''. It also airs [[Miami Dolphins]] preseason football games from [[WFOR-TV]] in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Tampa Bay Rays]] games from [[WXPX-TV]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], and [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] football / basketball games from [[Raycom Media|Raycom Sports]]. WXCW is one of two major Fort Myers-based stations licensed to Naples (the other being [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WZVN-TV]]). In addition to being offered free over-the-air, the station's [[HDTV|high definition]] signal is located on Comcast digital channels 206 or 236.  ==History== The station began broadcasting on [[August 14]], [[1986]] as '''WNPL-TV'''. It was the second independent station in Southwest Florida. Channel 46 was beset with problems early on, most notably finding programming. As late as 1993, station personnel were often going to a local video store &amp; renting public domain videos to play on the station. Often, the station's graphics were misplaced &amp; the status of WNPL was constantly in doubt. From 1993-1998, the station carried [[Florida Marlins]] baseball games from [[WBFS-TV]] in Miami. It also aired [[Orlando Magic]] basketball during much of this time.   The situation changed on [[January 15]], [[1995]] when the station joined [[UPN]] as a charter affiliate. It changed its call letters to '''WTVK''' in September of that year. Those calls were previously used on what is now [[WVLT-TV]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. With a network backing it up, the station was able to change program content &amp; strengthen its signal. In 1998, WTVK switched its UPN affiliation with the area's cable-only [[The WB|WB]] affiliate &quot;[[WNFM-TV|WSWF]]&quot;. It adopted the on-air moniker ''WB 6''. On [[January 24]] 2006, UPN &amp; The WB announced that they cease broadcasting &amp; merge. The new combined network would be called '''The CW''', the letters representing the first initial of its corporate parents: CBS (the parent company of UPN) &amp; the [[Warner Bros.]] unit of [[Time Warner]].  On [[February 22]], [[News Corporation]] announced that they would start up another network called '''MyNetworkTV'''. The new network, which would be sister to [[FOX]], would be operated by [[Fox Television Stations|FOX Television Stations]] &amp; its syndication division [[Twentieth Television]]. [[MyNetworkTV]] was created in order to give UPN &amp; WB stations, not mentioned as becoming CW affiliates, another option besides becoming independent. It's also created to compete against The CW. On [[March 9]], Acme announced that most of its WB stations, including WTVK, would affiliate with The CW. However, it was likely that WTVK would receive the CW affiliation without the corporate deal. The area's UPN affiliate, &quot;[[WNFM-TV|WNFM]]&quot;, is a cable-only station. &quot;WNFM&quot; eventually joined MyNetworkTV which began broadcasting on [[September 5]]. WTVK began broadcasting The CW on [[September 18]]. On that date, WTVK became known on-air as ''CW 6''.  Back on [[May 15]] [[2006]], [[Acme Communications]] announced that it would sell WTVK to Sun Broadcasting, a local broadcaster owned by Joe Schwartzel. The sale was finalized on [[February 16]], [[2007]]. On [[March 2]], after Sun Broadcasting assumed control, the station changed its call letters to the current '''WXCW'''. After that, WXCW moved from its [[Bonita Springs, Florida|Bonita Springs]] studios to studio facilities in Fort Myers.  ==News operation== [[Image:Wxcw open.PNG|thumb|left|WXCW's news open.]]  The station airs the first hour of the nationally syndicated morning show, ''[[The Daily Buzz]]'', during the week from 6-7 AM. Starting on [[March 26]] 2007, WINK-TV began producing a nightly 10 o'clock newscast on WXCW. This was the 3rd 10 o'clock news established in the market after [[FOX]] affiliate [[WFTX]] &amp; WNFM. Right from the start, it emerged as the #2 ranked 10 PM production in the area. On [[May 25]], the WZVN-produced WNFM news stopped airing. This was the result of Comcast's frequent technical difficulties, which hindered on the show's ratings &amp; the popularity of the WXCW production.  Beginning on [[October 20]], WINK-TV was the 1st station in Southwest Florida to broadcast local news in [[HDTV|high definition]]. The station purchased new HD studio cameras, field cameras, weather computers &amp; graphics to complete the launch. The WXCW broadcasts were also included in the upgrade. On [[January 7]] [[2008]], WINK-TV added a 2-hour extension of its weekday morning news on WXCW. This displaced the 2nd &amp; 3rd hours of ''The Daily Buzz''. WXCW also began to rebroadcast ''WINK News Now at Noon'' @ 1 PM  ==News teams== [[Image:Wink wxcw anchors.png|thumb|right|Trey Radel and Stacey Adams anchor on weeknights.]] [[Image:Wxcw weather 2007.png|thumb|right|Meteorologist Scott Zedeker is seen on weeknights.]]  '''''The Daily Buzz'''''&lt;br&gt;''(Weekday Mornings 6-7 AM)'' *Anchors: **Andy Campbell **Andrea Jackson *News Updates: **Kia Malone  *Weather: **Mitch English  '''''WINK News Now This Morning'''''&lt;br&gt;''(Weekday Mornings 7-9 AM)'' *Anchors: **Rob Spicker **Sarah Augusthy *Weather: **Brian Monahan *Traffic: **Miriam Zamorano  '''''WINK News Now at Noon'''''&lt;br&gt;''(Weekdays 1-2 PM)''  *Anchor: **Lindsay Liepman *Weather: **Brian Monahan  '''''WINK News Now at 10''''' ''(10-10:30 PM)''&lt;br&gt;''Weeknights'' *Anchors: **Trey Radel **Stacey Adams *Weather: **Scott Zedeker  ''Weekends'' *Anchors: **Jeremiah Jacobsen  **Jennifer Stacy *Weather: **Amanda McDonald *Sports: **Randy Scott  ''WXCW uses additional news personnel from WINK-TV.

[http://www.schott.com/english/news/press.html?NID=1190 “Contributions to the Theory and Practice of Glass Fabrication”]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1879, Schott developed a new [[lithium]]-based glass that possessed novel [[optics|optical]] properties.  Schott shared this discovery with [[Ernst Karl Abbe|Dr Ernst Abbe]], which was the catalyst for a long professional relationship between the two.   In 1884, in association with Dr [[Ernst Abbe]] and [[Carl Zeiss]], Otto founded ''[[Glastechnische Laboratorium Schott &amp; Genossen]]'' (Schott &amp; Associates Glass Technology Laboratory) in Jena.  It was here, during the period 1887 through to 1893, that Schott developed borosilicate glass.  Borosilicate glass is distinguished for its high tolerance to heat and a substantial resistance to thermal shock (sudden temperature changes) and resistance to degradation when exposed to chemicals.  In 1926 Otto Schott retired from active work at Schott &amp; Associtates.  == See also == *[[Calculation of glass properties]]  ==Notes== {{reflist}}  &lt;!-- Google translate of part of the wikipedia.de article.  Otto Schott translates to Petrol Bulkhead (!?)  Among other things it sent a sample on [[Ernst Abbe]].  These samples had a for the first time reached [[Homogen]]itaet, which it made possible to accomplish spectrometric measurements.  From this developed it up to [[1884]] glasses, which completely new optical characteristics exhibited.  At the same time it began at the tafelglasfabrik in Witten cover glasses for microscopic to manufacture [[Praeparat]]e.  It broke through thereby so far of [[England|Englishmen]] held [[monopoly]] on this area, by manufacturing these cover glasses of approximately 20% more favorably.  A specialized scientific exchange of letters with the physicist Abbe led it finally 1882 to Jena.  There it based together with Ernst Abbe as well as Roderich Zeiss|Roderich and Carl Zeiss in the year 1884 a glass-technical laboratory, the later Schott AG|Jenaer glass work Schott &amp; comrade.  First limited to the melt by optical glaesern and thermometer glass, the enterprise expanded its product range owing to the invention of the heatproof Borosilikatglases 1887 (Jenaer glass) rapidly.  Despite growth the enterprise became only in this year profitable.  The massive production of heatproof glasses for lighting purposes (gas glow light cylinders for gas and petroleum lamps) justified the economic success of the company.  Of this glaesern up to 1909 more than 30 million pieces were sold.  The improvements of optical glasses reached by it, among other things it succeeded to manufacture it glasses of also finely gradated optical constants, made the development possible of efficient microscopes and telescopes.  The moreover one developed it new glass sorts.  Due to its outstanding achievements he got 1905 by the technical university at that time Dresden was lent.  1909 had the successful work of 1,090 coworkers and 1919|later also he retired ten years its portions of the work to the Carl Zeiss donation.  He still worked until 1926 in the work as a &quot;civil servant&quot; of the glass work and member of the management.

York is fired and Conners suspended.   Months later, Lorenz ([[Wesley Snipes]]) and four other criminals take hostages in a bank and demand to negotiate with Conners, who is reinstated for that purpose, but put under the surveillance of a new partner, young inspector Dekker ([[Ryan Phillippe]]). Conners shuts power down to open the doors and let a [[SWAT]] unit in, but there is an explosion, and the criminals flee using the ensuing panic and chaos.  A [[TV]] camera had caught a shot of one of the criminals, who is arrested together with his girlfriend at her home, where banknotes are found with a [[scent]] used to mark evidence collected by the police. Banknote serial numbers show that they were requested from evidence storage by inspector Callo, who had testified against York and Conners on the bridge incident, and is soon found shot dead in his home, in possession of incriminating evidence.  Dekker finds from surveillance cameras in the assaulted bank that a director's computer had been used by the robbers. It turns out that they installed a virus to transfer one billion dollars to their accounts (less than 100 dollars from over 10 million accounts, so as not to rouse suspicions); this had not yet been noticed because of the power having been shut down. The author of the virus is identified as a programmer with criminal record, who is found dead at his home.  Dekker makes the bank robber who had been caught confess that Lorenz is the brother of the criminal Conners shot dead on the bridge, and gives an address where he is to meet the two other robbers that night. The police suspects Lorenz wants to kill his accomplices, and indeed the house explodes, killing them together with Conners (who had entered to chase them).  Dekker is devastated but receives another call claiming to be from Lorenz, who eventually says Callo was insignificant in his plan. Dekker then finds that Callo's signature requesting material from the evidence storage was forged, and makes the officer who gave it away confess that Lorenz is actually York, who, outraged at his being fired, became a criminal. His cell phone is tracked, he is caught, and as he offers resistance is shot dead.  Finally, Dekkers finds that a banknote he was given by Conners to pay a lunch is also [[scent]]ed, and realises that he was involved with York. Conners had survived the explosion he himself had triggered to kill his accomplices, and had put his police badge in the dead body of the criminal whose identity Lorenz had assumed, so as to pass as dead and run away. This is confirmed by Dekkers as he searches Conners's house and finds incriminating evidence. He goes to an airport to arrest Conners before he escapes, but Conners phones him, compliments him on his sagacity, and escapes.  The title is connected to [[Chaos theory]], as all the seemingly chaotic and unrelated events in the beginning of the film are actually linked to each other.  ==Cast== *[[Jason Statham]] ... Det.

His history is given in more detail than those of his predecessors. [[Georges Dumézil]] argued that Gram was partially modelled on the god [[Thor]], in particular his defeat of [[Hrungnir]] and subsequent encounter with [[Gróa]].  The [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] word ''gramr'' means &quot;king&quot; and is probably the source of Gram's name, possibly through a misunderstanding of Saxo's.

With old and relatively well-established articles, perhaps we ought to establish some guidelines for what references are acceptable...in this case, is it enough for me to add the names of some books on the topic of &quot;traditional counties&quot;, and if not, what standard do I need to meet in order to add a source as a reference if I'm admitting off the bat I didn't write one word of the article in question?

The basic effect is that a miniature [[guillotine]] is shown, a spectator's finger is placed in the &quot;head&quot; hole, and the blade is either dropped or slammed onto the finger, which it goes through. In some versions, such as Chance Wolf's ultimate finger chopper, the finger is even seen to fall off. It is also shown in the movie ''[[Hostel (film)|Hostel]]'' as part as a [[torture]] museum that Paxton and his friends go to on their fateful holiday to [[Slovakia]].  {{magic-stub}}  [[pl:Gilotyna (iluzja)]] [[Category:Magic_tricks]]</text>     </revision>

He is most known as an author of historical fiction. __NOTOC__ Kaplický studied at [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Tábor]], finishing in 1914. In 1915 he was sent to the front in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] where he was taken captive (1916). Later he joined the [[Czechoslovak Legion]]. For his political opinions he was imprisoned by the legion and labeled as a traitor. After returning to [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1921 &lt;!-- the often seen 1919 data seems invalid, read the link below --&gt; he worked in civil service. During 1922 - 1950 Kaplický worked in several publishing houses associated with the [[Czech National Social Party|Czechoslovak Socialist Party]]. From 1950 he dedicated his time solely to writing.  The majority of Kaplický's works are historical fictions spanning the period from the [[Hussite Wars]] in the 15th century to the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|revolutionary upheaval of 1848]]. His novel ''Kladivo na čarodějnice'' (1963), about [[witch trial]]s in northern [[Moravia]] during 1670s is the best known because it served as the basis for movie by [[Otakar Vávra]] (''[[Otakar Vávra#Malleus Maleficarum|Malleus Maleficarum]]'', also translated as ''Witches' Hammer'' or ''Witchhammer'').  ==Works== ===Historical fictions=== * Kraj kalicha, 1945 - about Hussite period * Čtveráci, 1952 – about peasant uprising 1618–1620  * Železná koruna (2 volumes), 1954 – about hard life of common people after [[Thirty Year's War]] * Smršť, 1955  * Rekruti, 1956  * Listy z kronik, 1958 – five short historical stories from northern Bohemia  * Zaťatá pěst, 1959  * Kladivo na čarodějnice, 1963 – about witchcraft trials * Táborská republika (3 volumes), 1969 – about Hussite period  * Nalezeno právem, 1971 – about accusation of a Jew from ritual murder in 1687 * Škůdce zemský Jiří Kopidlanský, 1976 – from period of [[Jagiellon dynasty|dynasty of Jagellon]]  * Veliké theatrum, 1977 – about earliest phase of Thirty Year's war and preparations to [[Battle of White Mountain]] * Kdo s koho, 1979 – from period of dynasty of Jagellon * Život alchymistův, 1980 – life of [[alchemy|alchemist]] [[Edward Kelley]] ===For the youths=== * O věrnosti a zradě, 1959 – 15 short historical stories * Bandita, Paťara a spol., 1969 – for boys * Královský souboj, 1971 ===Others=== * Gornostaj, finished in 1921, published in 1936 – autobiographic novel about the imprisonment of dissenting legionnaires near [[Vladivostok]], on an island in [[Gornostai Bay]] * Dobří přátelé, 1961 – about love of nature * Ani tygři, ani lvi, 1966 – short stories about pet animals  * Od města k městu, 1975 – vandering of studenst throughout Czech lands  * Hrst vzpomínek z mládí, 1988  ==External links== * [http://literatura.kvalitne.cz/kap.htm Short biography] (in Czech) * [http://www.narod-sobe.cz/clovek/kultura/literatura/Autori_CS/Hasek_Jaroslav/index.htm History of Kaplický's imprisonment] (in Czech)  {{DEFAULTSORT:Kaplicky, Vaclav}} [[Category:Czech novelists|Kaplicky, Vaclav]] [[Category:Czech journalists|Kaplicky, Vaclav]] [[Category:Czech poets|Kaplicky, Vaclav]] [[Category:Czech children's writers|Kaplicky, Vaclav]] [[Category:1895 births|Kaplicky, Vaclav]] [[Category:1982 deaths|Kaplicky, Vaclav]] [[Category:Czechoslovak Legions in literature]]  [[cs:Václav Kaplický]] [[de:Václav Kaplický]] [[eo:Václav Kaplický]] [[sk:Václav Kaplický]]</text>     </revision>

Rather, he learned the game of hockey while attending school in [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]] as a boy. Erhardt was a passionate defenseman, sometimes playing in excess of 40 minutes each game. [http://www.bihwa.co.uk/hall_of_fame/erhardt.htm] An excellent athlete, Erhardt also excelled at [[tennis]], [[skiing]] and [[water-skiing]]. (He founded the [[British Water Ski Federation]].) [http://www.azhockey.com/Er.htm]  == National team success == {{MedalTop}} {{MedalSport | Men's [[Ice hockey at the Winter Olympics|Ice Hockey]]}} {{MedalGold| [[1936 Winter Olympics|1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] | [[Ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics|Team]]}} {{MedalBottom}} Erhardt was a member of the European and World Championship teams in 1931, the World Championship team in 1934 and 1935, and the captain of the team which won the European and World Championships, along with Olympic gold, in 1936. Of the twelve members of the 1936 team, Erhardt was the only one who was not a Canadian citizen of British birth or descent. Thirty-nine years old at the time, Erhardt is the oldest man ever to win an Olympic gold in ice hockey.[http://www.azhockey.com/Er.htm] The British defeated the prohibitive favourites, the Canadians, in capturing Great Britain's first and only gold medal in ice hockey.  == Retirement == After his Olympic success, Erhardt retired from hockey. He wrote a book in 1937 titled ''Ice Hockey'', became a referee, and joined the Council of the [[British Ice Hockey Association]], of which he became a lifetime Vice-President. Erhardt was elected to the [[British Ice Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1950, and was post-humously elected to the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] Hall of Fame in 1998.  == See also == * [[Ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics]]  == References == * [http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/features/feature/display.var.689646.0.playing_games_with_the_nazis.php Playing Games with the Nazis] * [http://www.bihwa.co.uk/hall_of_fame/erhardt.htm Carl Erhardt] * [http://www.azhockey.com/Er.htm A to Z Encyclopaedia of Hockey]  &lt;!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] --&gt; {{Persondata |NAME= Erhardt, Carl Alfred |ALTERNATIVE NAMES= |SHORT DESCRIPTION= Ice hockey player |DATE OF BIRTH= [[February 15]], [[1897]] |PLACE OF BIRTH= [[Beckenham]], [[England]] |DATE OF DEATH= [[May 3]], [[1988]] |PLACE OF DEATH= Not known }}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Erhardt, Carl}} [[Category:1897 births]] [[Category:1988 deaths]] [[Category:British Ice Hockey Hall of Fame]] [[Category:English ice hockey players]] [[Category:Ice hockey players at the 1936 Winter Olympics]] [[Category:Olympic ice hockey players of Great Britain]] [[Category:Olympic gold medalists for Great Britain]]</text>     </revision>

The fare control is located in the center of the platform, with exits on either end leading to Warren Street and Murray Street.  The station's configuration is unique, in that you enter from the sidewalk adjacent to City Hall Park directly onto the station platform, which makes this one of the widest platforms in the system. The northbound tracks are actually located in City Hall Park, while the southbound tracks are under the east side of Broadway. The fare control area is fenced off from the actual subway platforms. There is also an active tower at the north end, with a window that lets any waiting passengers observe [[New York City Transit Authority|Transit Authority]] goings-on. The platform tapers off towards the southern end, where the northbound and southbound platforms join.  The station's configuration, and the wide-open staircases to the sky above, is responsible for another distinguishing note: the number of birds that fly into and around the station.  This station was overhauled in the late 1970s, changing the station's structure and overall appearance. It replaced the original wall tiles, old signs, and incandescent lighting with more modern wall tiles, signs and fluorescent lights, as well as fixing staircases and platform edges.  == History of City Hall Station == &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:City Hall's Lower Level.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Stairway to the lower level]] --&gt;  The City Hall station is a bi-level station.  It was initially intended that the local trains on the BMT were to terminate on the upper level, while the express trains using the lower level would continue on through lower manhattan and the [[Montague Street Tunnel]].  However, plans were changed before this could be brought into effect, and excess construction was terminated.  As a result the lower level of the station which was to have been the express station is unused (except for non-rush hour storage of trains), as are the unused express tracks at [[Canal Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Canal Street]].  Another effect of this change is that the southern end of the upper level station slopes downward.  This is a result of platform lengthening, and as the initial plans called for the trains on the lower express platform to continue into lower Manhattan, the platform had to be adjusted.  ==Bus connections== *[[B51 (New York City bus)|B51]] *[[M1 (New York City bus)|M1]] *[[M6 (New York City bus)|M6]] *[[M15 (New York City bus)|M15]] *[[M22 (New York City bus)|M22]] *[[M103 (New York City bus)|M103]]  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==External links== *{{NYCS ref|http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/stations?202:3227|BMT Broadway Subway|City Hall}} *Station Reporter — [http://www.stationreporter.net/ntrain.htm N Train] *Station Reporter — [http://www.stationreporter.net/rtrain.htm R Train] *Station Reporter — [http://www.stationreporter.net/wtrain.htm W Train] *Abandoned Stations — [http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/citybmt.html City Hall (BMT) lower level]  [[Category:BMT Broadway Line stations]]</text>     </revision>

Sunny]] produced and with music direction by [[Naushad]]. The film stars [[Dilip Kumar]] and [[Nargis]]. A box-office success, the film became the second highest earning film of 1950, earning an approximate gross of Rs. 1,25,00,000 and a nett gross of Rs. 70,00,000. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Box Office India|title=Top Earners 1950|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=155&amp;catName=MTk1MA|publisher=boxofficeindia.com|accessdate=July 9|accessyear=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ==Plot== The film relates the story of a young man named Ashok ([[Dilip Kumar]]) who is in love with two different women from very different classes. Ashok hails from a wealthy family and has a job as a postmaster, but it is clear that his job requires little hard labor, aside from sending an occasional telegram, leaving him time to enjoy his comforts and [[playboy]] lifestyle, with his suits, [[cigarette]]s, [[painting]] and song writing and love for women. A girl named Bela, the poor and simple daughter of the former postmaster woos for his affections and is supported by her father who wants them to marry. Bela prepares his meals, teases and amuses him, and dreams of a longterm happy marriage.  [[Image:Babul2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Ashok is taught to play piano by Usha]] However, Bela has competition from the wealthy [[landowner]] Jamnadas's daughter Usha, who lives a lavish lifestyle in a hilltop [[mansion]] Usha, drives a foreign car and seems more suitable for Ashok the young postmaster. They share a love of fine art and music, and Usha falls in love with his singing and arranges for him to give her music lessons on her [[grand piano]] in a [[boudoir]] adorned with fine art. Bela, heartbroken, intervenes by revealing to Usha her misguided belief that Ashok has already professed his love for her. In a surprising display of class-transcending understanding, she agrees to renounce her love for Ashok in favor of Bela’s claim, and to accept a proposal from the [[aristocratic]] son of one of her father’s colleagues. As Usha’s wedding approaches, both she and Ashok become [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] and Bela has recurring [[nightmare]]s of a black-veiled rider coming to carry her away. Times become increasingly unhappy and it seems that their marriage plans will not go ahead as plannned.  ==Cast== [[Image:Babul3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Nargis as Bela who woos Ashok's affection]] *[[Nargis]] ...

Note the way in which the cinematographer uses contrast in lighting]] The film takes a theatrical form, largely attributed to the set of the film and script. Cinematographer Fali Mistry contributes much to the film with atmospheric lighting, especially during night scenes and is able to create an essence of darkness in the hill top mansion which adds to an element of suspense. A soundtrack of fifteen songs, mostly about the joys and pains of love in the film is closely connected to the dialogue. The best known song in the film ''Chod babul ka ghar'' (literally meaning ''Now you must leave your father’s house''), is performed when a newly-married girl departs from her maternal home and village. The lovesong ''Nadi kinare'' (''On the bank of a river'') is performed by Ashok and Usha and a group of boatmen. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uiowa.edu/~incinema/Babul.html Untitled Document&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * {{imdb title|id=0331186|title=Babul }}    [[Category:1950 films]] [[Category:Indian films]] [[Category:Hindi-language films]]  {{Bollywood}}</text>     </revision>

Debuting with the [[St Kilda Football Club]] in 1994, Lappin was known as a solid running half-back flanker. After five seasons with the Saints (including the 1997 [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]]), he moved to [[Carlton FC|Carlton]] where he established himself in a variety of roles. Initially he played as a goalsneak, but shifted into a sweeping [[Football (Australian rules) positions#Centre Half-Back|half-back]], or linkman, role, providing much of Carlton's rebound football as they rebuilt their backline in the early-mid 2000s; he would also rotate sparingly through the [[Football (Australian rules) positions#Midfield|midfield]].  Lappin is easily recognised on the field with his lightly built frame, for which he has attracted the nickname &quot;Skinny,&quot; and well-cut long hair.  He is a great mark, regularly outmarking players much bigger than him such as [[Fraser Gehrig]] and [[Barry Hall]]. Lappin took the [[Mark of the Year]] in 1999, with a [[specky]] on the goal-line in Carlton's round one game against [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]]. He has represented Australia in the [[International Rules]] series in three seasons, and is noted for kicking the round ball better than most of his teammates.  In 2004 he won [[All-Australian]] selection and was consistently among Carlton's best players, but in 2005 he didn't have a great year for the Blues, which led to him considering walking out on the club. His form continued to slide in 2006, and after a particularly poor game against the [[Western Bulldogs]] coloured by some soft efforts, Lappin was dropped to the [[Northern Bullants]]. He played two games there and improved his intensity; he averaged 29 disposals and 3.5 tackles in the four games after his return.  Lappin move primarily back into the forward line in 2007 with reasonable success. Following an injury, Lappin retired shortly before Carlton's final game of 2007, four games short of his 200th club game. He remained with the Carlton Football Club in a developmental role, acting as a playing assistant coach with the [[Northern Bullants]].  == External links == *{{Carlplayer|ref=13152}} *{{AflRleague|ref=M/Matthew_Lappin.html}} *[http://www.blueseum.org/cfc/tiki-index.php?page=Matthew+Lappin Matthew Lappin Profile in Blueseum]  {{DEFAULTSORT:Lappin, Matthew}} [[Category:1976 births]] [[Category:Carlton Football Club players]] [[Category:St Kilda Football Club players]] [[Category:All-Australians]] [[Category:Northern Bullants players]] [[Category:Living people]]</text>     </revision>

The adult is a small thin gray moth with fringed wings. The larva is a dull white eight-legged caterpillar with conspicuous pink banding along its dorsum. The larva reaches one half inch in length.  The pink bollworm is native to Asia but has become an [[invasive species]] in most of the world's cotton-growing regions. It reached the cotton belt in the southern United States by the 1920s. It is a major pest in the cotton fields of the southern California deserts.  The female moth lays eggs in a cotton boll, and when the larvae emerge from the eggs they inflict damage through feeding. They chew through the cotton lint to feed on the seeds. Since cotton is used for both [[cotton|fiber]] and [[Cottonseed oil|seed oil]], the damage is twofold. Their disruption of the protective tissue around the boll is a portal of entry for other insects and fungi.  Transgenic [[Bacillus thuringiensis|Bt cotton]] is resistant to the pink bollworm. Infestation on susceptible cotton is generally controlled with insecticides. Once a crop has been harvested, the field is plowed under as soon as possible to stop the life cycle of the new generation of bollworm. Unharvested bolls harbor the larvae, so these are destroyed. The plants are plowed into the earth and the fields are irrigated liberally to drown out remaining pests. Some farmers burn the stubble after harvest. Surviving bollworms will overwinter in the field and reinfest the following season. Populations of bollworms are also controlled with mating disrupting chemicals and releases of sterile males which mate with the females but fail to fertilize their eggs.  == References == *New Standard Encycolpedia, © 1990 Chicago, Illinois  ==External links== *[http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/r114301511.html Pink bollworm IPM]  [[Category:Moths]] [[Category:Agricultural pest insects]] [[Category:Invasive animal species]]  {{moth-stub}}</text>     </revision>

It was the city and county's main indoor venue until the [[Resch Center]] opened in [[2002]].  It also was the home arena for the [[University of Wisconsin-Green Bay]] [[basketball]] teams. The BCVMA opened in [[1957]]. It hosted the 1991 [[The Summit League|Mid-Continent Conference]] men’s basketball tournament and the [[Horizon League|Midwestern Collegiate Conference]] (now Horizon League) men's basketball tournament in 1998.  Currently the Arena continues to play host to concerts, ice shows, local sporting shows, high school graduations and other events, but has largely been phased out as a sports arena due to its age and lack of seating. This is largely due to the fact that most area sports teams that once used the arena currently play home games in the newer Resch Center, which is right next door.  Concert footage taken at the Arena was used in the music video of the song [[Every Rose Has Its Thorn]] by [[Poison (band)|Poison]].

The distance between U.S. 12 and Interstate 94 in particular is no more than 3/4 of a mile (1 km). The highway then expands to become a four-lane [[expressway]], with a full interchange at [[U.S. Route 6]]. It returns to intersections at grade after U.S. 6, and then elevates to a four-lane expressway for interchanges at [[Indiana State Road 2|State Road 2]] and [[U.S. Route 30]]. The remainder of the route is a two-lane rural road with at-grade interchanges.  The portion of the highway south of Interstate 80/90 and north of U.S. 30 is known as the '''Valparaiso Bypass''', but it is signed as the '''Van Ness Highway'''. The bypass replaces Calumet Avenue, which had taken Indiana 49 through downtown [[Valparaiso, Indiana|Valparaiso]].  The highway passes through the following communities, and intersects with highways at those locations:  * [[Chesterton, Indiana|Chesterton]] &amp;mdash; [[U.S. Route 12]], [[U.S. Route 20]], [[Interstate 94]], [[Interstate 80]]/[[Interstate 90]] ([[Indiana Toll Road]]), [[U.S. Route 6]] * [[Valparaiso, Indiana|Valparaiso]] &amp;mdash; [[Indiana State Road 2|State Road 2]], [[U.S. Route 30]] * [[Kouts, Indiana|Kouts]] &amp;mdash; [[Indiana State Road 8|State Road 8]] * [[Wheatfield, Indiana|Wheatfield]] &amp;mdash; [[Indiana State Road 10|State Road 10]] * Rural North-Central Indiana &amp;mdash; [[Indiana State Road 14|State Road 14]]  ==Major intersections== Source: INDOT Roadway Referencing System&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/indot/3361.htm|title=INDOT Roadway Referencing System}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{INinttop}} {{INint |county=Jasper |cspan=2 |mile=0.00 |road=[[Image:Indiana 14.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 14|SR 14]] |location=Jasper County |notes=SR 49 begins }} {{INint |mile=10.99 |road=[[Image:Indiana 10.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 10|SR 10]] |location=Wheatfield }} {{INint |county=Porter |cspan=7 |mile=20.40 |road=[[Image:Indiana 8.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 8|SR 8]] |location=Kouts }} {{INint |mile=29.73 |road=[[Image:Indiana 2.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 2|SR 2]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency begins |location=Valparaiso |lspan=3 }} {{INint |mile=29.73 |road=[[Image:US 30.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 30|US 30]] |notes=overpass }} {{INint |mile=30.83 |road=[[Image:Indiana 2.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 2|SR 2]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency ends after 1.1 miles }} {{INint |mile=36.73 |road=[[Image:US 6.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 6|US 6]] |notes=underpass |location=Porter County }} {{INint |mile=41.96 |road=[[Image:I-94.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 94|I-94]] |notes=overpass |location=Chesterton }} {{INint |mile=44.15 |road=[[Image:US 12.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 12|US 12]] |location=Porter |notes=SR 49 ends }} {{INintbtm}}  == References == &lt;references/&gt;  [[Category:State highways in Indiana|049]]</text>     </revision>

The highway forms part of the [[Lincoln Heritage Trail]].  SR 62 is known as the [[Lloyd Expressway]] within Evansville's city limits.  It is named in honor of former Mayor [[Russell G.

SR 67 is a two-lane highway from Vincennes to near [[Martinsville, Indiana|Martinsville]], where it becomes a four-lane limited-access highway.  SR 67 overlaps [[U.S. Highway 231]] from three miles southwest of [[Worthington, Indiana]], to six miles north of [[Spencer, Indiana|Spencer]], a distance of approximately 30 miles.  Once SR 67 reaches Indianapolis, as Kentucky Avenue, it overlaps [[Interstate 465]] around the south and east sides of the city until Exit 42, where SR 67 and [[U.S. Highway 36]] depart the city to the northeast as Pendleton Pike. U.S. Highway 36 splits off from State Road 67 in [[Pendleton, Indiana|Pendleton]] and proceeds east.  SR 67 joins [[Interstate 69]] from [[Anderson, Indiana|Anderson]] to [[Daleville, Indiana|Daleville]], where it leaves the interstate and becomes an expressway bypass that serves the south and east sides of [[Muncie, Indiana|Muncie]].  Northeast of Muncie, SR 67 wraps up its diagonal run in the same manner as it began:  as a rural, two-lane highway.  Portions of the  route overlap others.  ==Major intersections== Source: INDOT Roadway Referencing System &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in.gov/indot/3361.htm INDOT Roadway Referencing System]&lt;/ref&gt; {{INinttop}} {{INint |county=Knox |cspan=6 |mile=0.00 |road=[[Image:US 41.svg|20px]][[Image:US 150.svg|25px]] [[U.S. Route 41|US 41]]/[[U.S. Route 150|US 150]] |location=Knox County |notes=SR 67 begins }} {{INint |mile=11.05 |road=[[Image:Indiana 159.svg|25px]] [[Indiana State Road 159|SR 159]] |location=Bicknell }} {{INint |mile=14.20 |road=[[Image:Indiana 358.svg|25px]] [[Indiana State Road 358|SR 358]] |location=Knox County |lspan=4 }} {{INint |mile=19.09 |road=[[Image:Indiana 58.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 58|SR 58]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency begins }} {{INint |mile=20.39 |road=[[Image:Indiana 58.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 58|SR 58]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency ends after 1.3 miles }} {{INint |mile=22.48 |road=[[Image:Indiana 59.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 59|SR 59]] }} {{INint |county=Greene |cspan=2 |mile=34.62 |road=[[Image:Indiana 54.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 54|SR 54]] |location=Switz City }} {{INint |mile=38.58 |road=[[Image:US 231.svg|25px]] [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency begins |location=Greene County }} {{INint |county=Owen |mile=65.40 |road=[[Image:US 231.svg|25px]] [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency ends after 26.82 miles |location=Owen County }} {{INint |county=Morgan |cspan=3 |mile=82.48 |road=[[Image:Indiana 39.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 39|SR 39]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency begins |location=Morgan County }} {{INint |mile=85.82 |road=[[Image:Indiana 39.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 39|SR 39]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency ends after 3.34 miles |location=Morgan County }} {{INint |mile=95.86 |road=[[Image:Indiana 144.svg|25px]] [[Indiana State Road 144|SR 144]] |location=Mooresville }} {{INint |county=Marion |cspan=1 |mile=104.53 |road=[[Image:I-74.svg|20px]][[Image:I-465.svg|25px]] [[Interstate 74|I-74]]/[[Interstate 465|I-465]] |notes=underpass |location=Marion County }} {{INint |county=Hancock |cspan=1 |mile=111.34 |road=[[Image:US 36.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 36|US 36]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency begins |location=Hancock County }} {{INint |county=Madison |cspan=3 |mile=124.97 |road=[[Image:US 36.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 36|US 36]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency ends after 13.63 miles |location=Madison County |lspan=3 }} {{INint |mile=124.97 |road=[[Image:Indiana 9.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 9|SR 9]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency begins }} {{INint |mile=127.62 |road=[[Image:Indiana 9.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 9|SR 9]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency ends after 2.65 miles }} {{INint |county=Delaware |cspan=10 |mile=136.52 |road=[[Image:I-69.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 69|I-69]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency begins |location=Delaware County |lspan=10 }} {{INint |mile=138.67 |road=[[Image:I-69.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 69|I-69]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency ends after 2.15 miles }} {{INint |mile=138.67 |road=[[Image:I-69.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 69|I-69]] |notes=underpass }} {{INint |mile=150.31 |road=[[Image:Indiana 3.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 3|SR 3]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency begins }} {{INint |mile=151.61 |road=[[Image:Indiana 3.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 3|SR 3]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency ends after 1.3 miles }} {{INint |mile=151.61 |road=[[Image:US 35.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 35|US 35]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency begins }} {{INint |mile=157.73 |road=[[Image:US 35.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 35|US 35]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency ends after 7.42 miles }} {{INint |mile=161.20 |road=[[Image:Indiana 28.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 28|SR 28]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency begins }} {{INint |mile=165.39 |road=[[Image:Indiana 28.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 28|SR 28]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency ends after 4.19 miles }} {{INint |mile=166.33 |road=[[Image:Indiana 167.svg|25px]] [[Indiana State Road 167|SR 167]] }} {{INint |county=Jay |cspan=6 |mile=172.17 |road=[[Image:Indiana 1.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 1|SR 1]] |location=Redkey }} {{INint |mile=181.58 |road=[[Image:Indiana 26.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 26|SR 26]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency begins |location=Jay County |lspan=5 }} {{INint |mile=183.54 |road=[[Image:Indiana 26.svg|20px]] [[Indiana State Road 26|SR 26]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency ends after 1.96 miles }} {{INint |mile=183.54 |road=[[Image:US 27.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 27|US 27]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency begins }} {{INint |mile=190.73 |road=[[Image:US 27.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 27|US 27]] |type=concur |notes=concurrency ends after 9.15 miles }} {{INint |mile=199.24 |road=[[Image:OH-29.svg‎|20px]] [[Ohio State Route 29|OH 29]] |notes=SR 67 ends }} {{INintbtm}}  ==References== &lt;references/&gt;  [[Category:State highways in Indiana|067]]</text>     </revision>

After his hockey career, he had a successful military career, participating in [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]].  ==Hockey career== Born in either [[Calgary]] [http://www.bihwa.co.uk/hall_of_fame/dailley.htm] or [[Winnipeg]] [http://www.city.cambridge.on.ca/cs_pubaccess/hall_of_fame.php?aid=71], Dailley attended the [[University of Manitoba]] before moving to England in 1933. By some accounts, Dailley earned his passage across the Atlantic Ocean by working on a cattle boat. [http://www.bihwa.co.uk/hall_of_fame/dailley.htm] Upon his arrival in England, Dailley joined the [[Grosvenor House Canadians]] (later the [[Wembley Canadians]]), playing defence. [http://azhockey.com/Da.htm] Dailley later played for the [[Wembley Lions]], and was captain of the [[Wembley Monarchs]] from 1937 until the outbreak of World War II.  ==International championships== Dailley was a member of the team which won the gold medal in [[ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics|ice hockey]] for Great Britain at the [[1936 Winter Olympics]]. The team consisted mostly of British-born Canadian citizens, as well as Dailley, whose only justification for playing for Britain lay in his long residency in England. Two players (including [[James Foster (ice hockey player)|Jimmy Foster]]) hadn't even received the proper papers to allow them to play for Great Britain. (The [[Canadian Olympic Committee]] launched a formal protest, which was defeated.) [http://www.olympic.ca/EN/media/2006_handbook/history.shtml] The gold in 1936 was the first and only ice hockey gold for Great Britain.  Dailley continued to play for the British national team, and was named its captain upon the resignation of [[Carl Erhardt]] in 1937. He led the team to European Championships in 1937 and 1938, [http://www.city.cambridge.on.ca/cs_pubaccess/hall_of_fame.php?aid=71] after which he left hockey to join the [[Canadian Army]].  ==Military service== Dailley served in England throughout [[World War II]]. After the war, he remained in the [[Canadian Forces]], holding various posts in [[Ottawa]]. He participated in the [[United Nations]] [[peacekeeping]] force in [[Korea]], and was promoted to [[Colonel]] in 1955. He was the military attaché for Canada in [[Belgrade]], [[Yugoslavia]] from 1955 to 1960, after which he became the base commander at [[CFB Gagetown]], [[New Brunswick]]. He retired from the military in 1964.  ==Post-military life== Dailley was prominent in the New Brunswick community after his retirement from the [[Canadian Forces]]. He formulated plans for the [[African Lion Safari]], the first game farm in Canada to feature exotic species in a drive-through reserve.

She landed triple axels in five consecutive competitions in 2005 (Yamanashi Kokutai 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nakano Finished 11th at 4CC |url=http://www.wasedasports.com/skate/050223.php |work= |publisher=WasedaSports.com |date=2005-02-23 |accessdate=2007-08-07 }} &lt;/ref&gt;, Kanto Gakusei Freeskating Championships&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nakano Won Again at the Competition.Showed Her New Choreography |url=http://www.wasedasports.com/skate/050528.php |work= |publisher=WasedaSports.com |date=2005-05-28 |accessdate=2007-08-07 }} &lt;/ref&gt;, Tokyo Figure Skating Championships&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.skatingjapan.jp/National/2005-2006/Figure/Block3/data0705.pdf | title = Tokyo Figure Skating Championships 2005 Judges Scores | accessdate = 2007-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Skate Canada International]], and Asian Figure Skating Championships&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nakano Won at the Asian Championships |url=http://figureskating.weblogs.jp/blog/2005/11/post_ae91.html |work= |publisher=Figure Skating News |date=2005-11-17 |accessdate=2007-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ). At the Skate Canada, she became the first woman to land a triple axel under the ISU Judging System in ISU Senior level competition &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.isufs.org/results/gpcan05/GPCAN05_Ladies_FS_Scores.pdf | title = Skate Canada 2005 ISU Judges Scores | accessdate = 2007-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. She placed 5th at the 2005-2006 Nationals, missing a berth on the Olympic team.  At the 2005-2006 Tokyo Figure Skating Championships, she landed all six triple jumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.skatingjapan.jp/National/2005-2006/Figure/Block3/data0705.pdf | title = Tokyo Figure Skating Championships 2005 Judges Scores | accessdate = 2007-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;So she became the first woman to perform all 6 kinds of triple jumps under the ISU Judging System in national level.  At the 2006-2007 Japanese Nationals, she placed third behind [[Mao Asada]] and [[Miki Ando]], earning one of three spots to represent Japan at the 2007 World Figure Skating Championships, where she finished 5th.  In her regional competition at the beginning of the 2007-2008 season, Nakano landed her first clean triple axel in two years. She consistently attempted the triple axel that season, being credited with it at the [[2007 Skate Canada International]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isufs.org/results/gpcan07/sc07_Ladies_FS_Scores.pdf |title=2007 Skate Canada Ladies Free Skating Protocol |accessdate=2007-12-29 |format=PDF |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[2007 Cup of Russia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isufs.org/results/gprus07/gprus07_Ladies_FS_Scores.pdf |title=2007 Cup of Russia Ladies Free Skating Protocol |accessdate=2007-12-29 |format=PDF |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the [[2007-2008 Grand Prix Final]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isufs.org/results/gpf0708/gpf0708_Ladies_FS_Scores.pdf |title=2007-2008 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final Ladies Free Skating Protocol |accessdate=2007-12-29 |format=PDF |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The 80486DX2 is identical to a [[Intel 80486DX|80486DX]] but for the addition of &quot;[[clock doubling]]&quot; technology.  It was the first chip to use clock doubling, whereby the processor performs two [[clock cycle]]s per single cycle of the memory bus. Essentially, the processor's speed is set to double of the speed of the system bus. Because of this, an Intel 80486DX2 is slower than an [[Intel 80486DX]]-based system at the same processor speed.  &lt;small&gt;Chart created by: [[User:uberpenguin|uberpenguin]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[Wikipedia:Picture_of_the_day/{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}|Archive]] - [[Wikipedia:Featured picture candidates|Nominate new image]]&lt;/small&gt; |}</text>     </revision>

As the series title suggests, in gym class, Adam was paired up with Jake Spidermonkey and the two are now best friends. Jake's plans have them getting involved in situations which end up with Adam in trouble. Adam, being physically weak, is often preyed upon by the other animals students. His personality is downtrodden, due to being in an animal school and he also has a reputation of complaining about his daily experiences at the school. Adam can be [[selfish]] and strongwilled at times. Outside of school, he is often seen with a human girl named Kerry, with whom he has a secret crush. His efforts to impress her end up with Adam's embarrassment.  Adam is voiced by [[Nika Futterman]].  === Jacob P. &quot;Jake&quot; Spidermonkey === &lt;!-- needs rewrite to improve readability --&gt; Jake, as his last name implies, is a [[spider monkey]] who quickly became Adam's best friend. He is often very possessive of Adam and hates not having him around regularly. Jake is emotional and goofy who takes to heart some of Adam's comments and actions, leading to some overly dramatic and exaggerated reactions. He can be lazy and selfish, but at the same time he is also fairly sensible. A running gag in the series is his [[obsession]] with the well-being of his butt. Along with the majority of the other animal students, Jake lives close enough to the school that he can see it from where he lives. Jake is also capable duplicating the voice of Principal Pixiefrog.&lt;ref name=&quot;Up All Night&quot;&gt;Up All Night&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jake's Day Off&quot;&gt;Jake's Day Off&lt;/ref&gt; of Jake has a big brother who is at high school. Jake also has a cousin who's the butler of a celebrity.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Prince and the Pooper&quot;&gt;The Prince and the Pooper&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt; Jake is voiced by [[Tom Kenny]].  === Ingrid Giraffe === A female [[masai giraffe]], Ingrid is the tallest student in CDMS. Her towering height only adds to her feelings of insecurity as she tries desperately to blend into the background. She is often seen with her neck going up then heading down on the screen in an exaggerated hunch since it is very long and is often seen from the neck down. Lupe, Ingrid's best friend, often hushes her when she gives advice. Ingrid has a crush on Adam Lyon, of which is he is mostly unaware, or he chooses to ignore it. Ingrid has a stepsister who is at high school. One distinctive talent Ingrid has is dancing while wearing a [[baseball cap]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Disregarding Henry&quot;&gt;Disregarding Henry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Save The Drama For Your Llama&quot;&gt;Save The Drama For Your Llama&lt;/ref&gt; Lupe accompanies her in this act. She's also considered to be the weakest in the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Save The Drama For Your Llama&quot;&gt;Save The Drama For Your Llama&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingrid Through The Door&quot;&gt;Ingrid Through The Door&lt;/ref&gt; Ingrid is voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]].  === Lupe Toucan === Lupe is a female [[toucan]], who is loud-mouthed, acerbic, dominating and materialistic, although she considers herself to be mild-tempered and low maintenance. Her best friend is Ingrid. Lupe loves popular culture, such as celebrities and fashion. She however doesn't like milk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yesterday's Funny Monkey&quot;&gt;Yesterday's Funny Monkey&lt;/ref&gt; She speaks with a somewhat exaggerated [[Chicano]] dialect and is known to have some issues involving what she sees as her overly large beak. Lupe has a big sister who's in high school.  Lupe is voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]].  === Slips Python === Slips is an easy-going, street-talking green tree [[Pythonidae|python]]. He is an [[underachiever]] and excessive daydreamer who's gullibility allows him to believe anything he hears, which makes him a constant source of misinformation. As a snake he has no limbs, yet wears a tee-shirt. He is usually seen with his best friend Windsor. Slips has a cousin who is a tomboy who is at high school. Slips can also be used a stairway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyon of Scrimmage&quot;&gt;Lyon of Scrimmage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lupe In Love&quot;&gt;Lupe In Love&lt;/ref&gt;  Slips is voiced by [[Rick Gomez]].  === Windsor Gorilla === Windsor is a highly intelligent [[lowland gorilla]] who serves as the anti-bully at the school and often gives confusing [[wisdom]] to people. He speaks in a soft-spoken and nearly monotonous manner, often stringing together technical words as a matter of his normal speech (the tone is similar to that of [[Butt-head]]). When he talks, only the side of his mouth closest to the camera moves and the rest of his mouth remains closed. He is usually seen with Slips and is generally shown to be the leader of the two. Windsor tends to relate with Adam's troubles better than the rest of the school, having a good grasp of both human and animal worlds. Windsor is the smartest of the group and is interested in space and space travel. Windsor has a big brother who is at high school. Windsor even has a puppet which seems to have a mind of its own.&lt;ref name=&quot;Talking Teddy&quot;&gt;Talking Teddy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Docutrauma&quot;&gt;Docutrauma&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;That Darn Platypus&quot;&gt;That Darn Platypus&lt;/ref&gt;  Windsor is voiced by [[Rick Gomez]].  == Secondary characters == === Virgil &quot;Bull&quot; Sharkowski ===  The school's bully, Virgil &quot;Bull&quot; Sharkowski is a [[bull shark]] who enjoys beating up smaller kids and stealing their lunches. His intimidating presence, however, is offset by a high-pitched, squeaky voice that sometimes lessens the impact of his verbal threats. Despite being a bully, he also has a soft humane side that he doesn't usually realize he's revealing. Due to Bull being a water creature, he wears water-filled headphones over his gills to help him breathe; when he talks, he'll stop as his gills suck up the water with a loud noise. His nickname is a mildly obscure reference to the fact that bull sharks are known to be the most aggressive of all shark species. Bull has a big sister that makes him sad when she is mentioned and is in high school. She is shorter than him. Voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]].  === Henry Armadillo === Henry is an [[armadillo]] who is one of the show's &quot;comic relief&quot; characters, wearing large glasses (which magnify his eyes), is socially insecure and struggles making friends and is portrayed as the stereotypical nerd. It likely though he may be the most unintelligent in the school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Making the Grade&quot;&gt;Making the Grade&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a reporter in the school media.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poop Scoop&quot;&gt;Poop Scoop&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Law and Odor&quot;&gt;Law and Odor&lt;/ref&gt; Voiced by [[Tom Kenny]].  === Dickie Sugarjumper === A [[rodent]] of a fictional genus&lt;ref name=&quot;ivyleague&quot;&gt;The Ivy League&lt;/ref&gt; with stereotypical British mannerisms. There is some controversy to his species, because of his name, yet in one episode, Mrs.Warthog said his last name was a typo. He made a successful career as a writer for the school's greatest class clowns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yesterday's Funny Monkey&quot;&gt;Yesterday's Funny Monkey&lt;/ref&gt; His notable catch phrase is ''&quot;Hello! How's your trousers?&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;Yesterday's Funny Monkey&quot;&gt;Yesterday's Funny Monkey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;That Darn Platypus&quot;&gt;That Darn Platypus&lt;/ref&gt; Voiced by [[Tom Kenny]].  == Faculty == === Principal Poncherello W. Pixiefrog === CDMS [[principal (school)|principal]], as his last name implies, is a [[frog]]. As a strict but fair administrator he runs a tight ship, which is somewhat remarkable considering he could easily be squashed underfoot by most of his students and the rest of the faculty. Principal Pixiefrog always dodges lawsuits, is terrified of lawyers and is scared when anyone in the school could get sued (He is shown to have Liticaphobia). Adam always asks him if anything bothers him, this frog principal will always help him to see. It is also revealed that Principal Pixiefrog has a mother who bothers him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Basic Jake&quot;&gt;Basic Jake&lt;/ref&gt; He once had a girlfriend named Lenore (This was a reference to [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s poem, &quot;[[The Raven]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gorilla My Dreams&quot;&gt;Gorilla My Dreams&lt;/ref&gt; After Principal Pixiefrog screamed &quot;LENORE!&quot;, a raven flew and smacked into his window. He won the Principal of the Year award.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pride and the Pixiefrog&quot;&gt;Pride and the Pixiefrog&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, he was stripped of it due to a dispute and the title was offered to Principal Wolverine, a principal who temporarily replaced him once.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaf of Absence&quot;&gt;Leaf of Absence&lt;/ref&gt; Voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]].  === Mr. Cyrus Q. Hornbill === Adam and Jake's homeroom teacher, an [[Indian Rhinoceros]], who also teaches math, science and geography. He appears to have a crush on the cafeteria lady, Mrs. Eugenia Tusk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Two Tons of Fun&quot;&gt;Two Tons of Fun&lt;/ref&gt; He is the weakest of the teachers, who couldn't beat a small toad in wrestling,&lt;ref name=&quot;Two Tons of Fun&quot;&gt;Two Tons of Fun&lt;/ref&gt; nor drive away a taunting bird named Ted who decided to stand on Cyrus' horn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hornbill and Ted's Bogus Journey&quot;&gt;Hornbill and Ted's Bogus Journey&lt;/ref&gt; Voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]].  === Mr. Maurice Bob Mandrill === A [[mandrill]] who is the school's spiritual [[guidance counselor]], the band director (being an expert on [[bongo drum]]s) and an advisor to the student court. A stereotypical portrayal of &quot;touchy-feely&quot; guidance counselors, an aged hippy an ex-[[hobo]]. Voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]].  === Mr. Blowhole === An [[orca]] who is Spiffies homeroom teacher. He teaches students about spelling to win a Spelling Bee. Like the Spiffies themselves, he also wears glasses. A howling sound [[Echo (phenomenon)|echos]] after his voice. Voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]].  === Mrs. Winifred Warthog === Principal Pixiefrog's assistant; she does all of the filing and is, obviously, a [[warthog]]. Ironically, she never works and rarely speaks. In ''The Big Field Trip'', Mrs. Warthog was the bus driver. Completely fed up with her job and her employer, she always has an air of complete exasperation about her. Her voice is identical to that of Nurse Gazelle. In ''That Darn Platypus'', it is revealed that she spends most of her time playing computer [[solitaire]] and gets very agitated when she is unable to play. It is shown in ''Little Mermonkey'' that she enjoys fishing, since it's &quot;hardly work&quot;. Portrayed by [[Grey DeLisle]].  === Miss Loon === A female [[loon]] in charge of the school's creative writing classes and painting classes. Her character is an allusion to [[Katharine Hepburn]], who played loon-loving Ethel Thayer in ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]''. Voiced by [[Cree Summer]].  === Miss Chameleon === A female [[chameleon]] who is the drama instructor and art teacher. As expected from a drama teacher, she is a drama queen, who speaks overly melodramatically and will often have stereotypical horror music playing when on-scene. She can blend into her surroundings and turn invisible, although in reality, that is a popular misconception about chameleons. She holds class while perched on a twig located under a warming lamp. Voiced by [[Nika Futterman]].  === Mrs. Eugenia Tusk === CDMS's [[lunch lady]], a female [[elephant]] who speaks with a [[Jamaica]]n accent, despite being African. She cares more about making money than she does for the students whom she serves. Sample cuisine at CDMS includes dirtnuts, dirt tarts, grass sandwiches, peanut burritos, twigs n' berries, mud squares, bug soups and wormy joes. She is a married elephant, as indicated by the [[Mrs.]] [[English honorific|honorific]] in her name (which she had to point out to Mr. Hornbill when he revealed his crush on her), though her husband has not yet appeared on-screen.  Voiced by [[Cree Summer]].  === Coach Tiffany Gills === &lt;!-- What episode revealed her first name? --&gt; &lt;!-- I don't think any of them did. --&gt; &lt;!-- From recollection it might have been &quot;Have Yourself A Joyful Little Animas&quot; but may have been mentioned before. --&gt; A female [[goldfish]]; Coach Gills is the school's tiny, deep-voiced PE and health teacher who instructs her students from inside her fishbowl. Though she looks rather sweet, she's no pushover. She never hesitates to give Adam a hard time if he doesn't perform as well as his fellow students. In ''Le Switcheroo'', she and Adam trade roles for a day. After experiencing some trouble, they at last reconciled. She has mentioned several times in the series that she has no friends. She once had a crush on Mr. Cheetah, an athletic individual who plans to succeed her and Principal Pixiefrog in their careers. Ironically, though she is a fish, she apparently cannot swim.&lt;ref name=&quot;An Inconvenient Goof&quot;&gt;An Inconvenient Goof&lt;/ref&gt; She is voiced by [[Brian Doyle-Murray]].  === Vice-Coach Horace Ferret === Coach Gills' [[ferret]] assistant, who rarely smiles and never talks due to being [[muteness|mute]]. He has a &quot;strictly professional relationship&quot; with Coach Gills, in which he pushes her fishbowl around. However he does talk in the special episode, Animal School Musical.  === Nurse Gazelle === [[Image:Nurse Gazelle.jpeg|thumb|right|Nurse Gazelle]] A [[gazelle]] who serves as the school nurse of CDMS. She has blond hair and blue eyes. She also has a brain the size of a soy nut (she mentions they're really tiny and dry) and that she can't tell between a mirror's reflection and the animal looking into the mirror or the difference between two slightly similar but not identical animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Innoculation Day&quot;&gt;Innocuation Day&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, when Adam and Jake created nasty clones of themselves, she was able to differentiate them just before Principal Pixiefrog, who was with her, did.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Two Jakes &quot;&gt;The Two Jakes&lt;/ref&gt; She is a nurse who specializes in [[injection (medicine)|injection]]. She's also a cosmetologist.&lt;ref name=&quot;An Inconvenient Goof&quot;&gt;An Inconvenient Goof&lt;/ref&gt; Portrayed by [[Grey DeLisle]].  == Other Humans == === Kerry Anderson === A girl with dark hair, a pink shirt and blue jeans. She's one of Adam's friends from his old school before he was mistakenly transferred. Adam has a crush on her, although his plans to impress her mostly end in vain because of Jake's animal friends. She was also in the Chester Arthur Cheerleading Squad (the Peppy Pep Girls).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheer Pressure&quot;&gt;Cheer Pressure&lt;/ref&gt; Portrayed by [[Cree Summer]].  ===Chad=== Chad is a bully from Adam's old school, Chester Arthur Middle School. He enjoys making fun of Adam. Voiced by [[Tom Kenny]].  ==References== {{Reflist}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:My Gym Partner's a Monkey}} [[Category:Lists of characters in television animation]]</text>     </revision>

She was the [[Identical twins#Monozygotic twins|identical twin sister]] of [[Amalie Auguste von Bayern|Queen Amalie of Saxony]], consort of [[John I of Saxony|King John I of Saxony]], and sister of [[Sophie, Princess of Bavaria|Archduchess Sophie of Austria]], mother of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria]] and [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico]]; as well as [[Princess Ludovika of Bavaria|Ludovika, Duchess in Bavaria]], mother of Franz Josef's consort, [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Empress Elisabeth of Austria]] (''Sisi''). She was known within her family as '''Elise'''.   On [[November 29]], [[1823]], she married the future King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] and supported his intellectual interests, namely his attempts at artwork, which he held dear to his heart.  In 1830, Elisabeth converted to [[Protestantism]].  Becoming Queen consort of Prussia in 1840, she was never without influence in Prussian politics, where she was active in preserving the close friendship between Prussia and the [[Austrian Empire]].  To Frederick William IV, she was an exemplary wife and, during his long illness, a dedicated nurse.  After his death on [[January 2]], [[1861]], Elisabeth lived quietly at her seats at [[Sanssouci]], [[Charlottenburg]], and [[Stolzenfels]] and dedicated herself to charity work in memory of her late husband . Her brother-in-law, Emperor [[Wilhelm I of Germany]], held her in high regard as a true friend.  During a visit to her sister, Queen Amalie of Saxony, Elisabeth died in 1873 in [[Dresden]].  She was buried next to her husband on [[December 21]] at the [[Church of Peace (Sanssouci)|Friedenskirche]] in [[Potsdam]].  ==References== *The information in this article is based on that in its German equivalent. * Moritz Freiherr von Bissing: ''Elisabeth Königin von Preußen'', Berlin 1974. * Ludovika Hesekiel: ''Elisabeth Luise, Königin von Preußen'' (Berlin 1881). * Dorothea Minkels: &quot;Porträts der preußischen Königin Elisabeth in der Sammlung des Stadtmuseums Berlin.&quot; in: Jahrbuch 2004/5 Stadtmuseum Berlin, pg. 278-304. * Alfred v.

Trams are distinguished from other forms of rail-bourne vehicles in that they travel wholly or partly along tracks laid down in streets, usually on track reserved for the tram system.

When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. --&gt;  The result of the debate was '''no consensus''' to delete the article. [[User:Mailer diablo|Mailer Diablo]] 06:23, 4 March 2006 (UTC)  ===[[Glyconutrient]]=== Glyconutrient(s) is a term coined and used by con-artists to bilk cancer patients out of their money.  There is ''no such thing.  Every last claim they make is bogus.  Every scientific reference they list says something very different from what they imply it says''.  There is no way they should be allowed to use Wikipedia to try and give the topic more credibility.  These charlatans repeatedly offer money support to [http://www.glycobiology.org the Society for Glycobiology] and their offers are repeatedly refused because legitimate scientists would never allow themselves to be associated with this in ANY way.  This article needs to be removed, and any opinion otherwise is self-serving and should be ignored. [[User:Stauffenberg|Stauffenberg]] 05:41, 26 February 2006 (UTC) *&lt;s&gt;'''Clean up''' and add to [[List_of_alternative%2C_speculative_and_disputed_theories]].&lt;/s&gt; [[User:Bobby1011|Bobby1011]] 05:46, 26 February 2006 (UTC) *'''Clean up''' as per above.[[User:Animalfanatic04|Animalfanatic04]] 05:48, 26 February 2006 (UTC) *&lt;s&gt;'''Merge or delete'''. As a biological engineer, I'm quite offended by the lack of science present in this article. &quot;Cellular braille&quot;? And I don't see how a &quot;glyconutrient&quot; differs from a carbohydrate. The assertion that glycosylation is part of genetic expression is ludicrous. Glycosylation is only important when you're building a glycoprotein. The sentence about &quot;glyconutrition&quot; makes me want to abandon my career path and become a [[forest ranger]]. At any rate, if this article is allowed to remain I strongly suggest that we merge it per Bobby1011. Compare with [[Thermic_effect_of_food|thermic effect of food]], which at least states that there is no source rather than making something up.&lt;/s&gt; [[User:Isopropyl|Isopropyl]] 06:23, 26 February 2006 (UTC) *'''Redirect''' to Orthomolecular medicine. I've just noticed that glyconutrients already get a mention on the [[List_of_alternative%2C_speculative_and_disputed_theories]] as [[Orthomolecular medicine]]. Therefore we need only redirect this page to that one, and no rewrite is required. [[User:Bobby1011|Bobby1011]] 06:40, 26 February 2006 (UTC) ::Strongly disagree with Redirect as disruptive to Orthomolecular medicine, pls see my discussion at [[Talk:Glyconutrient]] --12:36, 27 February 2006 (UTC) *'''Strong delete''' per nom and [[User:Isopropyl|Isopropyl]]. Most of the &quot;information&quot; in this article is completely ''fraudulent''. Not &quot;alternative&quot;, not &quot;speculative&quot;, not &quot;disputed&quot;, but pure unadulterated bullshit. Whatever tiny pieces of the article are actually true can be '''merged''' ''by an expert'' into [[Glycoprotein]], if said expert feels they're worth saving. Otherwise, nuke with extreme prejudice and salt the earth. --[[User:Aaron|Aaron]] 06:55, 26 February 2006 (UTC) *'''Comment'''.  An attempt was made to close this AfD prematurely by  [[User:Bobby1011|Bobby1011]] on 26.02.2006.  There was no consensus to speedy anything.  I've removed the inappropriate closure.  -&lt;font color=&quot;#2000C0&quot;&gt;[[User:Ikkyu2|ikkyu2]]&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;font color=&quot;#00FF00&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Ikkyu2|talk]]&lt;/font&gt;) 01:12, 27 February 2006 (UTC) *'''Keep'''.  Wikipedia content does not have to be true; it just has to be sourced ([[WP:V]]).  There are plenty of [[quack]] theories on the Wikipedia; it is appropriate to include traditional scientific viewpoints on these theories in the article.  (See [[IAHP]] and [[Orthomolecular medicine]] for examples.)  What's not appropriate is to censor these articles wholesale.  It's also '''definitely''' inappropriate to ram them through AfD with less than 24 hours up, and then close them with a &quot;speedy redirect&quot; when there was no consensus to do so&lt;s&gt;and I '''strongly censure''' the folks who attempted that.&lt;s&gt;  -&lt;font color=&quot;#2000C0&quot;&gt;[[User:Ikkyu2|ikkyu2]]&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;font color=&quot;#00FF00&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Ikkyu2|talk]]&lt;/font&gt;) 01:12, 27 February 2006 (UTC) :In defense of [[User:Bobby1011|Bobby1011]], he actually posted a note on my [[User_talk:Isopropyl|talk page]] explaining to me why deleting this article is a disservice to the community. He qualified it using the same logic that you are using now, and probably closed/redirected when he saw the information was already available at another article. Don't be too harsh on him; though he might have acted prematurely, it was probably in good faith. Although I disagree with the article, I am changing my vote to a conditional '''keep''' provided that it gets ''overhauled''. [[User:Isopropyl|Isopropyl]] 06:19, 27 February 2006 (UTC) ::It's clear that everything that was done was done in good faith.

The entire web is filled with this crap.  Search the term on google.  This is an ENCYCLOPEDIA.  It could remain and be appropriately described which would only serve as debunking the con, and then it would be POV.  Why should anyone have to devote time to debunking this?  The &quot;glyconutrient&quot; crowd go out of their way to imply scientific validation where none exists.  It is not appropriate to state something and provide a list of scientific articles as references when NONE of the scientific articles say anything even remotely close to what they are implied to say.  That is FRAUD.  The only reference you could provide for this is self-serving books written by the fraudsters or their websites.  How is that appropriate?    I just decided.  I'm the second coming.  Bow down to me.  Worship me.  Reference...ME!  Clearly...POV.  As is the term &quot;glyconutrient&quot; by it's very FRAUDULENTLY MANUFACTURED nature.  &lt;small&gt;&amp;mdash;''The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by'' [[User:Stauffenberg|Stauffenberg]] ([[User talk:Stauffenberg|talk]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Stauffenberg|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!--Inserted with Template:Unsigned--&gt; :These are strong arguments - for improving the article via consensus editing.

No.  Do you deny that books have been published about them?  No.  Since those things are true, why should you know about them, but not the Wikipedia reading public?  You should also consider that not everyone shares your opinion of these theories, which fact is encyclopedic in itself.

Over his 10 year career he played with two different teams: the [[Oakland Athletics]] (1980-1987), and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (1988-1989). He was originally selected by the Athletics in the 3rd round of the 1977 amateur draft and signed as a [[free agent]] with the Dodgers before the 1988 season.  Davis was a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers team that won the 1988 [[World Series]].  He is most remembered as the Dodger who earned the base on balls that enabled [[Kirk Gibson]]'s memorable walk-off [[home run]] that won game 1.  He lives in [[London, Ontario]].  ==External links== * [http://www.baseball-reference.com/d/davismi02.shtml Baseball Reference] * [http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=davismi02 Baseball Almanac] {{1988 Los Angeles Dodgers}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Davis, Mike}} [[Category:1959 births|Davis, Mike]] [[Category:Living people|Davis, Mike]] [[Category:People from San Diego, California|Davis, Mike]] [[Category:Major League Baseball players from California|Davis, Mike]] [[Category:Major League Baseball outfielders|Davis, Mike]] [[Category:Oakland Athletics players|Davis, Mike]] [[Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players|Davis, Mike]] [[Category:Major League Baseball right fielders]]  {{Baseball-right-fielder-stub}}</text>     </revision>

In these buses, lines under 30 (except those starting with 0) are trolleybuses (except 18,21). There are some air-conditioned buses in trolley lines. *Line numbers between 200 and 299 are mostly run during rush-hours, with some exceptions where those numbers are used for conventional buses. *Line numbers between 300 and 399 are night buses. *Line numbers between 400 and 499 are cross-river buses. Though there're many other cross-river bus lines that start with numbers other than 4. *Line numbers between 500 and 599 are special-line buses (专线车). *Line numbers between 600 and 699 are special-line buses in Pudong. *Line numbers between 700 and 799 are suburban conventional lines. Most 7XX bus have at least one terminal beyond Outer Ring Road (A20 Road). *Line numbers between 800 and 899 are special-line buses. Most of them are mid-size buses, but now they are being replaced with air-conditioned large buses. *Line numbers between 900 and 999 are special-line buses. Most of them are full-size and air-conditioned.  ====Alphabet Lines==== *Tunnel Lines Tunnel Line 1 to 9 (except Tunnel Line 5) runs across the tunnel under Huangpu River. While being the same as 4XX buses, there're many other buses that cross that tunnel while not named as a tunnel line. *Bridge Lines Bridge Lines 1 to 6 run across the bridge over Huangpu River. While being the same as 4XX buses, there's many other buses that cross the bridge while not named as a bridge line. *Airport Lines Airport Lines 1 to 7 (8 coming soon) connect Pudong Airport to downtown, while Airport Special Line (机场专线) connects Hongqiao Airport to downtown. *Other Lines There will be various additional naming schemes in the alphabet lines. Most lines are named as &quot;XY Line&quot;, where X and Y indicate the two terminals of this line ''e.g.'', &quot;莘纪线&quot; (Xin Ji Line) is a bus which runs between Xinzhuang and Jiwang.  Some other lines only indicate one termianl ''.e.g.'', &quot;宝杨码头专线&quot; (Baoyang Port Special Line) is a bus which runs between Baoyang Port and Shanghai Railway Station.  In the central portion of some suburbs, there are lines with the name format of &quot;XX No. X&quot; line, for example &quot;Songjiang No.1&quot; and &quot;Anting No.1&quot;  ===Fare=== *No. 01 Line ordinary bus has two prices — 1 yuan and 1.8 yuan — while air-conditioned is 2 yuan.  The fare for children is 1 yuan. *Other line numbers under 400, those between 700 and 799, tunnel lines, and bridge lines are ordinary buses charge 1yuan (not more than 13km) or 1.5 (over 13km), and if air-conditioned, 2yuan. *three-digit Line number starting with 5,6,8,9 use mutil-level prices starting from 1 yuan. *Some use a single price (单一票价), while some use mutil-level price.  ===Card=== All single price and numbered lines and most multilevel priced lines accept the &quot;[[Shanghai Public Transportation Card]].&quot;  ===External References=== * [http://www.shanghaibus.net/ ShanghaiBus.Net - bus photos and information] ''(Chinese only)'' * [http://msittig.wubi.org/bus/talk/ Shanghai Bus System Tutorial (for non-Chinese speakers)] * [http://www.panoramio.com/photo/154729 What Do You Say To A Shanghai TAXI Driver?] * [http://www.panoramio.com/photo/154843 How Do You Ask For The WAY in Shanghai?]   [[Category:Transport in Shanghai]]</text>     </revision>

It was released in 1995 and packaged with [[Mac OS 7]] on new [[Macintosh Performa]] computers. It is a [[third-person shooter]] game with a single camera angle almost directly above the character. The player's character is an [[action figure]] named Power Pete who has to save the [[rabbit|fuzzy bunnies]] of the doll department from the bad toys while progressing through the fifteen levels of the game. It has graphics similar to early [[SNES]] games. The game has a catchy background tune and sayings from the character. It is rated [[ESRB|E for Everyone]]. It won Best Arcade Game of the Year for 1995 from ''[[MacWorld]]'' magazine and was a runner up in the ''[[MacUser]]'' magazine Best New Game award for 1995. Pangea regained the rights to it in 2001 and re-released it in upgraded form as a shareware named '''Mighty Mike'''. The new version runs on [[Mac OS 9]] and Classic compatible [[Mac OS X]] operating systems, although it won't run on Intel-based Macs.   == Story line == The story of Power Pete revolves around the title character, Power Pete.  Power Pete is an action figure residing in a toy store.  After the store closes, the all of the toys come alive and chaos ensues.  A group of plush rabbits escape from their bin and scatter throughout the store, helpless against the hoards of the more dangerous toys.  The only one able to save them is the most popular toy in the store, the action figure Power Pete.  Power Pete begins a crusade to try to find and save the rabbits.  The other toys in the store, who's sales have been eclipsed by those of Power Pete are less than happy to see the action figure and spend the game trying to hinder his efforts.  Power Pete is aided however by the variety of weapon accessories designed for the Power Pete model that are found throughout the store. == Levels == The game is divided into five departments, each with three areas. The first department is Prehistoric Plaza where Power Pete is assaulted by lots of [[cavemen]] and a diverse array of dinosaur toys. The second department is Candy Cane Lane. Here Power Pete fights off [[gingerbread men]], [[marzipan]] bears, animated [[Mint (candy)|mints]], and other sugary treats. The third department is Fairy Tale Trail with depictions of classic villains like the [[Big Bad Wolf]], the witch of [[Hansel and Gretel]] and the giant from [[Jack and the Beanstalk]]. The fourth department is the Magic Funhouse with evil clowns, [[jack-in-the-box]]es, and carrot wielding rabbits popping out of hats. The final department is the Bargain Bin. Here Power Pete encounters cars, tops, psycho robots and general chaos.  The number of worlds a player can enjoy is dependent on the difficulty level. While only three worlds are available on easy, four are available on medium, and all five can be played on hard.  == Game play == The player moves about each area shooting bad toys and rescuing fuzzy bunnies. Fuzzy bunnies are rescued by walking up to them. Once Power Pete rescues all the fuzzy bunnies the player can move on to the next area. The harder levels and departments have more powerful [[weapon]]s and more resilient toys. When a bad toy is shot enough times with a powerful enough weapon, it explodes showering [[confetti]] and [[Gobstopper|jawbreakers]], which can be collected like coins in [[Super Mario Bros.]] Sometimes a power-up will appear where the destroyed toy used to be. This can be either [[ammo]] or a special power-up. Weapons and ammo aren't collected separately in the game, so having ammo means having the weapon. Special power-ups have temporary effects and include &quot;fire in the hole&quot; (many small explosions everywhere), invulnerability, an expanding ring of fire, an enemy freezer, or superspeed. The jawbreakers and power-ups created upon destruction of a toy disappear after a few seconds. There are power-ups spread throughout the different areas of each department that won't disappear until activated. Power-ups activate immediately when Power Pete walks over them. There is a fuzzy bunny [[radar]] screen that shows the position of nearby bunnies relative to the player, although the lay out of the game map makes it extremely difficult to reach some otherwise nearby bunnies. Unless the game is set to the easy difficulty setting there are doors or barriers marked with colored dots in each area. The player must collect correspondingly colored [[key (lock)|keys]] spread around each area to unlock them. Keys are picked up like other power-ups. Collected keys display in a special section of the status bar until they are used, at which point they disappear. The keys for each department look different in each department. They are, in order from first to last: [[hammers]], [[key (lock)|keys]],  [[bombs]], [[tickets]], or [[radio control]]s.  == Health and scoring ==  Power Pete starts out with four [[health]] hearts per life. Each time Power Pete is hit by a bad toy, he loses a heart. The number of starting lives varies depending on the difficulty setting the player chose at the beginning of the game. Power Pete can replenish his health by eating [[food]] power-ups that are found through out the game, one heart per-power up. Food can't be picked up if Power Pete is already at full health. If the player collects 200 or more jawbreakers in an area Power Petes maximum health hearts per life will increase by one heart, up to a maximum of eight, at the beginning of the next area or department. Extra lives are gained by finding hidden &quot;FREE DUDE!&quot; Power Pete action figure power-ups and by reaching certain score thresholds. Points are awarded during gameplay for shooting bad toys. Upon completion of an area, points are awarded for jawbreakers and fuzzy bunnies collected in that area.  == Weapons ==  Power Pete is known for its variety of weapons available to the player. Each has its own advantages and drawbacks.   *Suction Cup Gun - A gun that shoots suction cup darts. The player's beginning weapon, it is very weak, has a limited range, and has a low rate of fire.   *[[Rock (geology)|Rock]] - The run of the mill rock, it is thrown like a grenade.  It has a short range, but does however do a decent amount of damage.  *[[Musket]] - This weapon, found early in the game, shoots a round projectile that looks somewhat like a small cannon ball.  The weapon has a fast rate of fire, long range, and does a large amount of damage.  *[[Flamethrower]] - The flamethrower, while extremely powerful, has a very limited range.  It shoots a continuous stream of fire and as such, consumes ammunition very quickly.   *Double-Barrelled Gumball Blaster - A double barreled gun that shoots colorful two colorful gumballs at a time.  It has a standard rate of fire and does a mediocre amount of damage.   *Triple-Barrelled Gumball Blaster - A better version of the double-barrelled gumball blaster, it fires three gumballs at a time and has a fast rate of fire.  *[[Toothpaste]] - A rather weak weapon, it shoots a continuous stream of toothpaste a short distance.   *Heat Seeker - This gun fires a missile that will seek the nearest target.  The missiles move very slowly however and a second missile can not be fired until the first missile finds its mark, as such, it is considered the worst weapon in the game by many.  *[[Pie]] -A pie that when thrown explodes, covering its target in food.  *Exploding Birthday Cake - A cake that is thrown at a target.  While it has a short range, it can effect multiple enemies and does a very high amount of damage, killing most enemies in one hit.  *Fairy Dust -This weapon launches a ball of &quot;magic&quot; at the enemy.  While it has a slow rate of fire, its range is unlimited.  *Rubber Band Gun - The rubber band gun, as its name implies, shoots rubber bands. These rubber bands bounce around against solid objects until they hit an enemy. It comes in two version, the only difference being the amount of damage they inflict.   *[[Rocket Launcher]] - A extremely powerful weapon, it destroys everything in the direction the player fires it in. Unfortunately, the player has to wait for the first rocket to finish before launching another.   *[[Gatling Gun]] - This gun fires shot after shot very quickly, but it is ineffective against the more powerful enemies.  == References == *[http://www.pangeasoft.net/mightymike/index.html The Pangea Software Mighty Mike Homepage]  == External links == *[http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Arcade/7334/ The Unofficial Power Pete Page] *[http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/mac/game/578852.html Walkthrough] *[http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Arcade/7334/powerpetedemo.sit.hqx Power Pete demo file download] (.[[hqx]]) *[http://www.pangeasoft.net/mightymike/download.html Mighty Mike download site]  [[Category:1995 video games]] [[Category:Mac OS games]] [[Category:Mac OS-only games]] [[Category:Pangea Software]] [[Category:Third-person shooters]]</text>     </revision>

The album peaked at #10 on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] pop chart.  While Stewart had performed and recorded as a solo act and as the member of various groups for nearly 20 years, ''Bombs Away Dream Babies'' represented his first, and only, major commercial success.  The album is a fairly straightforward [[Rock music|rock]]-[[Pop music|pop]] album with tinges of the [[Folk music|folk]] that had been Stewart's staple genre.  The appearance of [[Lindsey Buckingham]] and [[Stevie Nicks]] added to the commercial success of the album as well as contributing greatly to the overall sound of the album. Buckingham's guitar work is understated by his usual standards but integral to the sound achieved while his vocals are a solid counter-point to Stewart's rugged baritone. Nicks' recognisable vocals add weight to the hits &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Midnight Wind&quot;.  &quot;Gold&quot; reached #5 on the pop chart, while &quot;Midnight Wind&quot; and &quot;Lost Her in the Sun&quot; made #28 and #34 respectively.  ==Track listing== All compositions by John Stewart. # &quot;Gold&quot; – 4:26 # &quot;Lost Her in the Sun&quot; – 3:51 # &quot;Runaway Fool of Love&quot; – 2:32 # &quot;Somewhere Down the Line&quot; – 2:52 # &quot;Midnight Wind&quot; – 4:30 # &quot;Over the Hill&quot; – 3:13 # &quot;The Spinnin' of the World&quot; – 1:42 # &quot;Comin' Out of Nowhere&quot; – 2:03 # &quot;Heart of the Dream&quot; – 3:21 # &quot;Hand Your Heart to the Wind&quot; – 3:56  ==Personnel== * John Stewart – Vocals, [[Guitar]], [[Kalimba]] * [[Lindsey Buckingham]] – Guitar, Vocals * [[Stevie Nicks]] – Vocals * Brian Garofalo – [[Bass guitar|Bass]], Vocals * Chris Whelan – Bass, Vocals * David Jackson – Acoustic Bass * Michael Botts – [[Drum]]s * Richard Slosser – Drums * Gary Weisberg – Drums * [[Russ Kunkel]] – Drums * Joey Carbone – [[Keyboard instrument|Keyboards]] * Wayne Hunt – Keyboards, Vocals * Mary Torrey – Vocals * Buffy Ford Stewart – Vocals * Christine DeLisle – Vocals * [[Mary Kay Place]] – Vocals * Joey Harris – Vocals * Croxey Adams – Vocals * [[Dave Guard]] – Vocals * Deborah Tompkins – Vocals * Catherine Guard – Vocals  ===Additional personnel=== * [[Rich Fitzgerald]] - executive producer * Riley Kathryn - album coordination * Herbert W.

(album)|Vs.]]'' (1993). It peaked at number three on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart. The song was included on [[Pearl Jam]]'s greatest hits album, ''[[rearviewmirror: Greatest Hits 1991–2003]]''.  ==Origin and recording== An early primitive jam version of the song can be found in the commercial breaks of the band's ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' performance. After &quot;Black&quot;, during the commercial beak, the band jammed into a short progression that would become the basic &quot;Dissident&quot; riff. This is clearly evident in bootlegs and video.  ==Lyrics== Frontman [[Eddie Vedder]] about &quot;Dissident&quot;: &lt;blockquote&gt;In &quot;Dissident&quot;, I'm actually talking about a woman who takes in someone who's being sought after by the authorities for political reasons. He's on the run, and she offers him a refuge. But she just can't handle the responsibility. She turns him in, then she has to live with the guilt and the realization that she's betrayed the one thing that gave her life meaning. It made her life difficult. It made her life hell. But it gave her a reason to be. But she couldn't hold on. She folded. That's the tragedy of the song.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Allan. ''[http://www.korat.co.il/pearljam/Ibook/Vs/dissident.html Pearl Jam - The Illustrated Story, A Melody Maker Book]''. Hal Leonard Corp, 1995. ISBN 0793540356&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  ==Release and reception== The song peaked at number three on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart. Outside of the United States, the single was released in [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], [[South Africa]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. &quot;Dissident&quot; reached the UK Top 20. &quot;Dissident&quot; peaked at number 97 in Germany, reached the top 30 in [[France]], and was a top ten success in [[Ireland]] and [[Norway]]. It was a moderate top 20 success in the [[Netherlands]]. &quot;Dissident&quot; is one of the band's most enduring singles as it has remained a popular song on many rock stations.  ==Live performances== The song was premiered live at the band's May 13, 1993 concert in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pearljam.com/songs/song.php?song=Dissident &quot;Pearl Jam Songs: &quot;Dissident&quot;&quot;].

He was the youngest of the surviving sons of Count [[Günther XL of Schwarzburg-Blankenburg]] and his wife Countess [[Elisabeth zu Ysenburg-Büdingen in Birstein]].  All possessions, which were united under his father, came after the death of Günther XL in 1552 to his four surviving sons, [[Günther XLI of Schwarzburg-Blankenburg|Günther XLI]], [[Johann Günther I of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen|Johann Günther]], [[Wilhelm I, Graf von Schwarzburg-Blankenburg|Wilhelm I]] and Albrecht VII, who divided their country in 1571. After the deaths of childless Günther XLI in 1583 and Wilhelm I in 1597, his possessions were divided between the still living brothers Johann Günther and Albrecht VII. This partition became the beginning of two lines of the [[house of Schwarzburg]], [[Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt]] and [[Schwarzburg-Sondershausen]], both of which existed until the post-[[World War I]] major governmental changes of 1918.  Albrecht, studied at several German universities and in [[Padua]]. From 1557 he resided at the court of the Princes of [[Orange-Nassau]]. He served from 1563 under his brother Günther in the army of King of [[Denmark]] and from 1573 lived in [[Rudolstadt]].  ==Family and children== He was married twice. Firstly, on [[14 June]] [[1575]] he married  Countess [[Juliana of Nassau-Dillenburg]], daughter of Count [[William I of Nassau-Dillenburg]] and had the following children: # Count [[Karl Günther I of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt]] ([[6 November]] [[1576]] &amp;ndash; [[24 September]] [[1630]]) # Elisabeth Juliane ([[1 January]] [[1578]] &amp;ndash; [[28 March]] [[1658]]) # Sophie ([[1 March]] [[1579]] &amp;ndash; [[24 August]] [[1630]]), married on [[30 March]] [[1595]] to Count [[Jobst II of Barby-Mühlingen]] # Magdalene ([[12 April]] [[1580]] &amp;ndash; [[22 April]] [[1632]]), married on [[22 May]] [[1597]] to [[Heinrich II Reuss zu Gera]] # Count [[Ludwig Günther I of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt]] ([[27 May]] [[1581]] &amp;ndash; [[4 November]] [[1646]]) # Albrecht Günther I ([[8 August]] [[1582]] &amp;ndash; [[20 January]] [[1634]]) # Anna Sybilla ([[14 March]] [[1584]] &amp;ndash; [[22 August]] [[1623]]), married on [[15 November]] [[1612]] to Count [[Christian Günther I of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen]] # Katharina Maria ([[13 July]] [[1585]] &amp;ndash; [[19 January]] [[1659]]) # Katharina Susanna ([[13 February]] [[1587]] &amp;ndash; [[19 April]] [[1662]]) # Heinrich Günther, died young in 1589  Secondly, on [[2 March]] [[1591]] he married with Countess Albertine Elisabeth of Leiningen-Westerburg, but this marriage was childless.

It uses a play structure called ''the Flow'' rather than the normal turn-based system typically used in the genre.  ==Backstory== '''''Ophidian 2350''''' takes place in the year 2350, where a strange reptilian race known as Ophidians run gladitorial arenas for humans, aliens and demons alike. Combat consists of one team pitted against another, and though competitors often die, the [[gladiator]]s' [[DNA]] is often taken before the match to resurrect the fallen warrior.  ==Gameplay== Each player's team is made up of up to four gladiators, usually one of each victory point (VP) level (ranging from 1 to 4), but a team can technically be made up of any combination that adds up to 10.  A player can win either by defeating an opponent's gladiators, by defeating gladiators worth a greater number of victory points after four ''waves'' (rounds) or by amassing 15 points worth of ''cheer'' from the audience.  Each side of the table is divided up into an ''action field'', where powerful gladiators can attack and protect others from attacks, and a ''support field'', where less powerful gladiators and supporting minions usually reside.  Between waves, cards can move between the two fields as needed.  Some of the game mechanics are recognizable from previous games such as [[Magic: The Gathering]] - cards are &quot;set&quot; when activated, being rotated ninety degrees to show that they have been used, which is identical to &quot;[[Tap (gaming)|tapping]]&quot; in Magic. However, the turns of previous CCGs are not present in '''''Ophidian''''', instead replaced by the ''the Flow''.  ==The Flow== The Flow is the system that replaces turns in '''''Ophidian''''', and allows both players to be active at one time, one &quot;with the Flow&quot; and the other without it. All actions are either positive (denoted by a plus), or negative (denoted by a minus). Players can play only when they have the Flow, and whilst positive actions allow one to keep the Flow and play additional actions, a negative Flow action gives Flow to the opponent. It is also possible to expend cheer to change an opponent's positive action into a negative action, and thus force a change in control of the Flow.  Certain actions (''responses'') can be played even without the Flow.  When both players have no further actions to take, the wave (round) ends, with both sides taking a ''breather''.  When the next wave starts, the Flow begins with the player who has the most damage on his or her gladiators (both alive and dead).  [[Category:Collectible card games]]</text>     </revision>

At present, the Puyang River is 150 kilometers long and empties into the Qiantang River northwest of Linpu (临浦镇).  The gazette of Xiaoshan County (蕭山縣誌)states: &quot;The Puyang River ... tends to flood easily because its catchment area is quite large, the course of the river is winding, the river bed descends in narrow channels, and the flow runs up against the incoming tide of the Qiantang Estuary.  Before the mid-15th century, the river ran east of Linpu to flow in a winding, snakelike course to the south of Xiaoshan (萧山) and the northwest of Shaoxing (绍兴市), leaving numerous lakes along its course before emptying into Hangzhou Bay.   The frequent flooding of the Puyang River has resulted in it being called the &quot;Little Yellow River.&quot; This is a reference to the [[Yellow River]], also known for flooding.  The river has its headwaters in Pujiang County (浦江县), a mountainous, scenic area in central Zhejiang, and runs through Zhuji (诸暨市), the home of the legendary beauty [[Xi Shi]]. Among the scenic sites located along or near the river are Matoushan (马头山), which has the shape of a horse's head, Nanshan ( 南山) with many strange rock formations,  Changshan (常山), and Guanyenshan (官岩山), where legend says Yu the Great ([[Yu (Xia dynasty ruler)]]) ordered the opening of a channel for the Puyang River. Some of these names appear to come from the Shanhai Jing 山海经: A Chinese Bestiary).  ==External links== * [http://texts.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft0q2n99mz&amp;chunk.id=d0e5493&amp;toc.id=d0e5493&amp;brand=ucpress]''Five Power, Legitimacy, and Symbol: Local Elites and the Jute Creek Embankment Case'', by R.

[[Image:Henson Airlines Shorts 330 at Baltimore - 11 September 1983.jpg|thumb|Short 330 of [[Henson Airlines]] in Allegheny Commuter colors.]]  Henson airlines initially developed a route structure serving Washington DC, Philadelphia and Baltimore while establishing a new headquarters for it and Allegheny Commuter at Salisbury, Maryland in 1968. In the 1970s, the airline upgraded to [[Shorts 330]] and [[Dash 7|De Havilland Dash 7]] [[turboprop]]s, which it used for Allegheny Commuter codeshare service until it was bought by Piedmont Aviation in 1983.  Another airline flying as an Allegheny Commuter was Fischer Brothers Aviation[http://www.airliners.net/search/photo.search?regsearch=N14FB&amp;distinct_entry=true], the reference depicting a Fischer Brothers Aviation aircraft pictured in a full Allegheny Commuter color scheme.  Allegheny Airlines became USAir with the arrival of airline deregulation.

The event started on Saturday [[February 9]] and ended on Sunday [[February 17]].   Originally scheduled for [[New Delhi]], [[India]] in December 2001 as a combined men's and women's event, the first Women's Champions Challenge was eventually moved to [[Randburg]] in February 2002 as a result of regional international situations at the time. Participating nations at the six nations tournament were [[England]], [[India]], [[Russia]], hosting nation [[South Africa]], [[South Korea]] and the [[United States]].  Each of the six teams play each other once in a round robin format to complete five preliminary round games. The top two teams at the end of the preliminary round matches play off in the final, with the winner earning a berth in the [[2003 Women's Hockey Champions Trophy|2003 Champions Trophy]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. The 3rd and 4th placed teams play for the bronze medal, while the 5th and 6th placed teams meet in the 5th place play-off.  ==Team squads== ==={{fhw|England}}=== &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:90%&quot;&gt; (1.)

     <title>Singing cowboy</title>     <id>4203749</id>     <revision>       <id>221270970</id>       <timestamp>2008-06-23T20:11:06Z</timestamp>       <contributor>         <username>VDB1909</username>         <id>7207850</id>       </contributor>       <comment>/* Into the sunset */</comment>       <text xml:space="preserve">A '''singing cowboy''' was a subtype of the archetypal [[cowboy]] hero of early [[Western (genre)|Western]] films, popularized by many of the [[B-movie]]s of the 1930s and the 1940s. The typical singing cowboys were white-hat-wearing clean-shaven heroes with the habit of showing their emotions in song.  Around the campfire, the original cowboys sang of life on the trail with all the challengers, hardships and dangers encountered while pushing cattle for miles up the trails that headed north. While much of what is included in the genre of &quot;cowboy music&quot; is &quot;traditional&quot;, a number of songs have been written and made famous by groups like the [[Sons of the Pioneers]] and [[Riders in the Sky]] and individual performers such as [[Gene Autry]], [[Roy Rogers]], [[Michael Martin Murphy]] and other &quot;singing cowboys.&quot; Singing in the [[wrangler]] style, these entertainers have served to preserve the cowboy as a unique [[United States|American]] [[hero]].   The image of the singing cowboy was established in 1925, when Carl T. Sprague of Texas recorded the first [[Western music (North America)|cowboy song]], &quot;When the Work's All Done This Fall.&quot; A year later, John I. White became the first representant of the genre to perform on a nationally broadcast radio show, but the full popularity of the singing cowboys wasn't reached until the spread of [[sound film]]s.  ==John Wayne== '''[[John Wayne]]''' was the screen's first singing cowboy. Wayne appeared as &quot;Singin' Sandy Saunders&quot; in '''''[[Riders of Destiny]]''''' (1933) but it wasn't an ideal fit since Wayne's singing voice was dubbed, making the obligatory personal appearances a continuous embarrassment for the 26-year-old actor.  Wayne's version of the singing cowboy was much darker than the later ones; his [[ten-gallon hat]] was black instead of white and he'd chant about &quot;streets running with blood&quot; and &quot;you'll be drinking your drinks with the dead&quot; as he strode purposefully down the street toward a showdown.  ==Gene Autry== While other Western actors, such as Wayne and [[Clint Eastwood]], only dabbled in singing roles, some actors became known mainly for their parts as singing cowboys. The most famous of them was '''[[Gene Autry]]''' and the moniker &quot;The Singing Cowboy&quot; usually refers to him in particular. Autry first rose to popularity as a singer, but his acting career started off quickly with the 1935 film [[Serial (film)|serial]], ''[[The Phantom Empire]]'' and he became a prolific star.  When John Wayne, the first singing cowboy, begged off because his singing had to be dubbed, the studio looked for a replacement and decided on Autry, a choice so successful that, at the time of his death in 1998, Autry was still on the top 10 list of Hollywood box office moneymakers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9810/02/autry.obit/ Gene Autry's obituary at cnn.com] &lt;/ref&gt;. Autry's early popularity, both for his radio and film performances, quickly paved the way for a multitude of imitators, but most attempts didn't get close to his success.  ==Roy Rogers== [[Image:RoyRogers8479.JPG|thumb|left|A mural of Roy Rogers at his hometown, [[Portsmouth, Ohio|Portsmouth]], [[Ohio]]. Rogers replaced Gene Autry at Republic Studios and became known as the &quot;King of the Cowboys&quot;.]] Autry's status as the top singing cowboy was never in question until 1937, when disagreements made him temporarily walk out on his contract with [[Republic Studios]]. The studio's chosen replacement, '''[[Roy Rogers]]''', who had previously appeared only in minor roles (including a memorable appearance opposite Autry while still billed under his real name, Leonard Slye), quickly grew popular when given the chance to star. By the time Autry returned, he found himself challenged for top movie singing cowboy status by the blossoming career of his new rival Rogers, although Rogers never neared Autry's juggernaut level of record sales. When Autry enlisted in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] during [[World War II]], Roy Rogers became the &quot;[[King of the Cowboys]],&quot; competing head-to-head with Autry for the rest of the decade (they never appeared together again on film).  ==Into the sunset== Other notable actors who became famous as singing cowboys were Jimmy Wakely, [[Tex Ritter]], and [[Rex Allen]], who didn't start his career until 1950, when the popularity of the genre was waning. [[Herb Jeffries]]  made four films beginning with the intriguingly titled ''[[Harlem on the Prairie (film)|Harlem on the Prairie]]''.  Singing cowgirl Dorothy Page made three films for [[Grand National Pictures]], the studio of Tex Ritter. With the fame of ''[[Rose Marie (operetta)]]'' and singing cowboy films, a series of films with actor singer James Newill playing a singing Mountie '''[[Renfrew of the Royal Mounted]]'' were released between 1937-1940.  Non-singing cowboy actors such as [[Buck Jones]] complained that producers would find it too easy to pad out the length of a film with songs rather than action, characterization, or plot exposition.  With the advent of television, the making of B-movies dropped off and the era of singing cowboys was coming to an end. Autry and Rogers went on to star in ''[[The Gene Autry Show]]'' and ''[[The Roy Rogers Show]]'' respectively, but the series' runs ended by the close of the decade, and the singing cowboy gradually ceased to exist in popular culture except as an exercise in nostalgia.  The singing cowboy image has since been parodied, most notably in the 1985 film ''[[Rustlers' Rhapsody]]'', with [[Tom Berenger]] portraying a stereotypical singing cowboy. Also the [[Pixar]] film [[Toy Story 2]].  ==References== &lt;!-- this 'empty' section displays references defined elsewhere --&gt; {{reflist}}  ==External links== *[http://www.bbhc.org/pointswest/PWArticle.cfm?ArticleID=20 Points West article: The Singing Cowboys: Real to Reel]  *[http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/cowboysongs.htm  Cowboy Songs and Singers]     * http://parentseyes.arizona.edu/cowboysongs/mormoncowboy.html  [[Category:Western]]  [[da:Westernmusik]]</text>     </revision>

He was the son and successor of [[Roger-Bernard I of Foix|Roger Bernard I]] and his wife Cécilia Trencavel.  When Raimond-Roger and [[Arnaud of Castelbon|Arnaud]], viscount of [[Castelbon]], wished to join their possessions, the Count [[Ermengol VIII of Urgell]] and [[Bernard de Villemur]], [[bishop of Urgell]], saw in this a threat and declared war. Overcome and captured, the count of Foix and Arnaud were imprisoned from February to September [[1203]]. King [[Peter II of Aragón]] intervened, however, wishing to spare them for his fight to conquer [[Languedoc]]. Moreover, Peter II gave as a [[fief]] the castles of [[Usson]] and [[Quérigut]] ([[1209]]) to Raimond-Roger, after having already given various other [[catalonia|Catalan]] seigniories ([[1208]]).  Raimond Roger was a close relative of [[Raymond VI of Toulouse]] and a staunch ally.  He was famed for his generalship, chivalry, fidelity, and affection for ''haute couture''. He was, besides a patron of [[troubadour]]s, an author of verse himself.  Though not a [[Cathar]] himself, several of his relatives were.  His wife, Philippa of Montcada, even became a ''parfaite''.  His sister, [[Esclarmonde de Foix]], was also a ''parfaite'', receiving the ''Consolamentum'' at [[Fanjeaux]] in [[1204]].  Raimond Roger was a great orator, and attended the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Fourth Lateran Council]] of [[1215]] to defend Raymond of Toulouse before [[Innocent III]] and the council.  He himself was accused of having murdered priests and did not deny it, instead he informed the pope that he regretted not having murdered more.   He had with Philippa of Montcada one son [[Roger-Bernard II of Foix|Roger Bernard]], who became his heir, and one daughter, Cécile de Foix, who married (c.[[1224]]) Count [[Bernard V of Comminges]]. He also had two illegitimate children.  {{start box}} {{s-bef|before=[[Roger-Bernard I of Foix|Roger Bernard I]]}} {{s-ttl|title=[[Count of Foix]]|years=[[1188]]-[[1223]]}} {{s-aft|after=[[Roger-Bernard II of Foix|Roger Bernard II]]}} {{end box}}  ==External links== * {{fr icon}} [http://www.foixstory.com/data/comtes/06.htm Histoire des comtes de Foix].

Although officially forming in 2003, the duet spent the following 2 years in separate countries, only able to write music together via the internet and on occasional visits.  Before &quot;officially&quot; uniting in mid 2005, the band had been featured on a European net-release and 2 compilation discs.   In 2004 '''The Bad Spellers''' traveled to Canada to collaborate/record with Justin Langlois of [http://thelondonapartments.com The London Apartments] ([[Universal Records]]/[[Beggar's Banquet Records]]).  These sessions were released in March, 2005 to national (USA/Canada) distribution on Florida's [[Post Records|Post*Records]] as &quot;Fall in Love,&quot; a split EP with [http://thelondonapartments.com The London Apartments]).  Tony and Yasuko have since returned to the US and Canada numerous times.  2007 saw the release of their first album, &quot;Keep on Shining!&quot;, on [[Post Records|Post*Records]] as well as the band's official legal marriage.    Their former official homepage, www.thebadspellers.com, was discontinued in 2008 for reasons unknown.  Since then all news, music, concerts, and other pertinent information has been presented on the band's [http://thebadspellers.vze.com/ official Myspace page].  ==Discography==  '''Albums:''' *Keep on shining! - POST015, 2007 [[Post Records|Post*Records]].

Ónodi, also known as &quot;Henni&quot; in the gymnastics community, began gymnastics in 1978 and made her international debut in 1986. Too young to qualify for the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]], she made her senior debut in 1989 and represented Hungary at the [[World Championships]] that year, where she placed 19th in the all-around and 5th in the [[balance beam]] event finals.   Over the next few years, Ónodi established herself as a medal contender at major events. In 1989 she became the first female Hungarian gymnast to medal at the European Championships with a gold on the [[uneven bars]]; at the 1990 Europeans she placed third in the all-around and the [[floor exercise]]. In 1990, she also finished third in the all-around at the [[Goodwill Games]] and the World Cup where she won the vault event. At the [[1991 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|1991 World Championships]] Ónodi suffered a sudden back injury but was able to win a silver medal on vault and helped the Hungarian squad qualify for the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]] with an eighth place finish in the team final.   The next year at the Olympics in [[Barcelona]], Ónodi became the first female Hungarian gymnast in over thirty years to win an Olympic gold medal. She tied with [[Romania]]n [[Lavinia Miloşovici]] for the gold in the [[Gymnastics vault|vault]] event final; on [[floor exercise]], performing to ''[[Hungarian Rhapsody]]'' she finished second behind Miloşovici. Ónodi's difficulty level on vault was actually higher than Milosovici's (they both used full twisting [[Yurchenko (vault)|Yurchenko]]s but Henrietta did a piked barani and Milosovici a tucked). Ónodi also performed the difficult triple twist on floor, then an unusual move (nobody else in the Barcelona floor finals did it).  Ónodi retired after Barcelona and attempted to compete in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] gymnastics, pursue her education at the University level and coach. She returned to international competition in 1995 at the [[World University Games]] and subsequently led the Hungarian team at the [[1996 Olympics]]. She retired again in 1997 after attending her second University Games.   Ónodi has made many contributions to gymnastics during her competitive career. Her [[Uneven Bars]] routine consisted of elements on the low bar at a time when most gymnasts did the minimum two elements on the low bar. She has a skill named after her in the ''[[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]]'', a [[handspring (gymnastics)|back handspring]] with a half turn on the [[balance beam]]. She also performed this skill on the floor, in combination with split leaps (it should be noted, however, that the skill was actually first done by the USSR's Olga Mostepanova in 1983). She was also the first gymnast to do a triple-twisting dismount from the beam, a skill she also performed on the floor.  == External links and references == *{{fig|id=4647|name=Henrietta Ónodi}} *[http://www.gymn-forum.net/bios/women/onodi_h.html List of competitive results at Gymn-Forum] *[http://www.gymnpics.com/gymnasticgreats/wag/onodi.htm Whatever happened to Henrietta Ónodi?] *[http://www.math.psu.edu/tseng/Henrietta.html Henrietta's Domain] Unofficial fan site  {{Gymnastics portal}} {{Template:Footer Olympic Champions - Artistic Gymnastics - Women's Vault}} {{NavigationWorldChampionsArtisticGymnasticsWomenVault}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Onodi, Henrietta}} [[Category:1974 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Hungarian artistic gymnasts]] [[Category:Olympic gold medalists for Hungary]] [[Category:Olympic silver medalists for Hungary]] [[Category:Gymnasts at the 1992 Summer Olympics]] [[Category:Gymnasts at the 1996 Summer Olympics]] [[Category:World champion gymnasts]] [[Category:Medalists at World Gymnastics Championships]]  [[fr:Henrietta Ónodi]] [[hu:Ónodi Henrietta]]</text>     </revision>

In 1985, it was acquired from [[Associated Dry Goods]] by [[Donaldson's|The L.S. Donaldson Company]] (also of Minneapolis, a unit of [[Allied Stores]] Corp.), which gave Donaldson's some breathing room against dominant rival [[Dayton's]]. In 1987, after Campeau Corp.'s buy-out of Allied Stores Corp., Donaldson's was purchased by [[Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co.]] of [[Chicago, Illinois]] which made the ill-fated decision to rename the stores with its own name.   Carson's in its turn was acquired by [[Bergner's|P.A. Bergner &amp; Co.]] of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] (and formerly of [[Peoria, Illinois]]) in 1989, which in turn filed for bankruptcy in 1991. In 1995 Carson's sold the rump of the former Twin Cities area locations (formerly Powers/Donaldsons) to Dayton's parent [[Dayton Hudson Corp.]], which re-opened most of them under its moderate [[Mervyn's]] chain, mostly in a move to prevent serious competition in its Twin Cities stronghold. In 2004 when Dayton's successor [[Marshall Field's]] was acquired by [[May Department Stores]], it also agreed to buy the former Donaldson/Powers locations operated by Mervyn's, and promptly shuttered them, selling the real-estate piecemeal.  ==Former Locations== {| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; !

They are very similar to [[Tamagotchi]] in that they have an [[LCD]] screen and controlling buttons, although they are  larger.  Based in a miniature house, there is a [[lounge]], [[kitchen]] and dining area, with steps leading upstairs. There are three different types of houses. They are marketed by [[Mattel Inc.]]  In the game, two or more houses can be connected together, allowing the characters (the Pixel Chix) to visit one another. These characters can be controlled in ways similar to other handheld games, such as Tamagotchi. They can be told go out for a walk, watch television, eat a variety of foods, such as [[popcorn]] and [[burger]]s, and go to sleep. The more they are played with, the more options appear to the player; higher levels introduce different types of food, more clothes and more places to visit. However; if they are neglected, they will decrease in skill level. Eventually, if neglected for too long, the game will end since the characters &quot;leave&quot;.  ==Food== *[[Popcorn]] (At the Beginning) *[[Sandwich]] (At the Beginning) *[[Soup]] (At the Beginning) *[[Banana]] *[[Drink]] *[[Burger]] *[[Chicken]] *[[Watermelon]] *[[Ice Cream]] *[[Apple]] *[[Pizza]] ==Clothes/Outfits== *Sleeveless Top w/Skirt and Pants(At the Beginning) *[[Nightgown]] (At the Beginning) *[[Schoolgirl]] Outfit (At the Beginning) *[[Sports bra]] w/Yoga Pants *[[Bikini]] *[[Raincoat]] *[[Tube top]] w/Pants *[[Rockstar]] Outfit *[[Ballerina]] Outfit *Short top w/Long Skirt *[[Robe]] (Only in 2 Storey) *[[Towel]] (Only in 2 Storey) *[[Pajamas]] (Only in 2 Storey) *[[Soccer]] Uniform (Only in 2 Storey)  ==Beauty Items== (Only in 2 Storey) *[[Comb]] (At the Beginning) *[[Hair spray]] (At the Beginning) *[[Perfume]] *[[Hairdryer]] *[[Make-up]]  ==Games== Level One: *[[Phone]] *[[TV]]  Level Two: *[[Magic 8-Ball]] *[[Fish Bowl]]  Level Three: *[[Dog]] *[[Cat]] *[[Radio]]  Level Four: *[[Guitar]]  Level Five: *[[Rollerblades]] *[[Karaoke]] Machine  ==Bathroom== (Only in 2 Storey) *[[Toothbrush]] (At the Beginning) *Washing Face (At the Beginning) *[[Toilet]] *[[Shower]] *&quot;[[Rubber Duck]]&quot; Bath  ==Accessories== A number of Pixel Chix accessories have been created, such as &quot;road trippin' cars&quot; which connect to the house. In the cars you can go to the [[mall]], go to the [[beach]], or do many different things (depending on the level of the Pixel Chix). The cars come in blue, [[purple]], and [[pink]].  Also available is the Pixel Chix ♥ 2 Shop mall. Where the Pixel Chix can work, [[shop]], play games, and take breaks at the mall. There are two different malls, a boutique/food court, and a [[pet shop]]/[[salon]]. Each mall has an LCD flip screen, allowing the Pixel Chix girl to change stores. They're able to connect to the houses, the cars, and other malls.  Another available accessory is the Pixel Chix 2 Story house. It is almost the exact replica of the original Pixel Chix, except that it has an upstairs bedroom. There, the Pixel Chix can put on make-up at the [[vanity]], go to the bathroom for some water fun, and much more. They come in dark and light pink, and are connectable to the cars, the malls, and other houses.  There are also Pixel [[Pets]], the animal equivalent of Pixel Chix. Dogs and hamsters are available. Further connection options include a &quot;roomies&quot; house with 6 floors. Also, in the UK, there are metallic Road Trippin' Cars and a [[glitter]] house. Also available is a babysitter house where the Pixel Chix looks after a baby girl. The red light flashes if the baby is doing naughty things. It also flashes when something is wrong or needs attention.  ==Film?== A film is possibly in the works, as this is the case with Mattel's other popular lines, Barbie, My Scene &amp; Polly Pocket.  ==Website== There is an official website of Pixel Chix on Everythinggirl.com. There are games, videos of TV commercials, t-shirt graphics, secret codes and a movie maker like [[Zimmer Twins]].</text>     </revision>

Jordan had his own sound on tenor saxophone almost from the start. He gigged around Chicago with [[Max Roach]], [[Sonny Stitt]], and some R&amp;B groups before moving to New York in 1957. Jordan immediately made a strong impression, leading three albums for [[Blue Note records|Blue Note]] (including a meeting with fellow tenor [[John Gilmore (musician)|John Gilmore]]) and touring with [[Horace Silver]] (1957-1958), [[J.J. Johnson]] (1959-1960), [[Kenny Dorham]] (1961-1962), and [[Max Roach]] (1962-1964). Jordan also recorded with these musicians.  After performing in Europe with Mingus and Dolphy, Jordan worked mostly as a leader, but tended to be overlooked since he was not overly influential or a pacesetter in the avant-garde. A reliable player, Jordan toured Europe several times, was in a quartet headed by [[Cedar Walton]] in 1974-1975, and during his last years, led a big band.   Clifford Jordan recorded as a leader for Blue Note, Riverside, Jazzland, [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] (a little-known album of [[Leadbelly]] tunes), Vortex, [[Strata-East Records|Strata-East]], [[Muse Records|Muse]], [[Frontier Records]], [[SteepleChase Records]], [[Criss Cross Jazz]], Bee Hive, DIW, [[Milestone Records|Milestone]], and [[Mapleshade Records|Mapleshade]].  {{DEFAULTSORT:Jordan, Clifford}} [[Category:Post-bop saxophonists]] [[Category:Hard-bop saxophonists]] [[category:Big band saxophonists]] [[Category:American jazz saxophonists]] [[Category:Chicago musicians]] [[Category:1931 births]] [[Category:1993 deaths]]  {{US-jazz-musician-stub}} {{US-woodwind-musician-stub}}  [[de:Clifford Jordan]] [[fr:Clifford Jordan]]</text>     </revision>

The album was only released in Sweden on [[April 14]] [[2004]]. It was later worldwide-released as ''[[The Way I Am (Ana Johnsson album)|The Way I Am]]'', becoming the commonly accepted first album by Johnsson. The only differences between the two albums is that the latter has a different cover and track listing. ''The Way I Am'' contains the first seven songs from ''Cuz I Can'' and some new tracks, including the huge hit &quot;[[We Are]]&quot;, which is the official soundtrack for the [[Spider-Man 2]] film, &quot;[[Don't Cry for Pain]]&quot; and &quot;[[Coz I Can]]&quot;, a remix of &quot;Cuz I Can&quot;. The leftover tracks were included as B-sides on the later released singles.  The ''Cuz I Can'' album spawned the singles &quot;[[The Way I Am (Ana Johnsson song)|The Way I Am]]&quot;, &quot;[[Life (song)|Life]]&quot; and &quot;[[Coz I Can|Cuz I Can]]&quot;, of which only &quot;Life&quot; charted in the Swedish Singles Chart, at number 17.  ==Track listing== #&quot;[[The Way I Am (Ana Johnsson song)|The Way I Am]]&quot; – 3:29 (A.

The conference dealt with several controversial issues, including compensation for slavery and the actions of Israel.  The language of the final Declaration and Programme of Action produced by the conference was strongly disputed in these areas, both in the preparatory meetings in the months that preceded the conference and during the conference itself.  Two delegations, the United States and Israel, withdrew from the conference after failing to agree to a common text with other countries.  The final Declaration and Programme of Action has been both supported and criticized, although it did not in the end contain the text that the U.S. and Israel had objected to, that text having been voted out by delegates in the days after the U.S. and Israel withdrew. The conference has been criticized as deliberately being hijacked by the anti-Israel lobby and ignoring the wider range of issues of racism.  In parallel to the Conference, a separately held NGO Forum also produced a Declaration and Programme of its own, that was not an official Conference document, which contained language relating to Israel that the WCAR had voted to exclude from its Declaration, and which was criticized by then [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Mary Robinson]] and many others.  The NGO Forum ended in discord.  Mary Robinson lost the support of the United States in her office of High Commissioner, and many of the potential political aftereffects of the Conference were annulled by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. The attacks took place just three days after the Conference ended, entirely eclipsing the Conference in the news, and significantly affecting international relations and politics.    == Preparations == The conference was authorized by [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution]] #52/111.  Prior to the conference, various preparatory meetings, PrepComs, were held, in order to identify conference themes and to create initial drafts of the Declaration and Programme of Action.  These PrepComs encountered difficulties from the start.&lt;ref name=Schechter&gt;{{cite book|pages=177&amp;ndash;182|title=United Nations Global Conferences|author=Michael G. Schechter|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|id=ISBN 0415343801}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first problem was the question of what the conference theme was to be.  The Western European states, along with the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, all wanted the conference objectives to be those given in the authorizing resolution.  The Africa Group, the Latin American states, and the Caribbean states wanted the conference objectives to go beyond what was in the resolution, and include items dealing with regional, national, and international measures for compensation for colonialism and slavery.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;  Prior to the conference, there were also four Regional Conferences, in Strasbourg, Santiago, Dakar, and Tehran.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt; ==The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action== The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action was adopted by the governmental delegates attending the Conference at the International Convention Centre. === Compensation for Colonialism and Slavery === The issue of Compensation for Colonialism and Slavery is addressed in ¶ 13, ¶ 14, ¶ 15, and ¶ 29 of the Declaration.  It was one of the most controversial issues debated at the conference, one that had the potential to derail the entire conference.  It was dealt with cleverly in the Declaration, containing rhetoric that satisfied the African bloc, without applying retroactively against the descendants of colonizers the principle of crimes against humanity and without establishing a clear responsibility for reparations on the parts of former colonial states.&lt;ref name=Chakma&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Rights in Development Yearbook 2001: Reparations: Redressing Past Wrongs|editor=George Ulrich and Louise Krabbe Boserup|chapter=The Issue of Compensation for Colonialism and Slavery at the World Conference Against Racism|author=Suhas Chakma|pages=58&amp;ndash;71|year=2003|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|id=ISBN 9041120300}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wording of the Declaration struck a delicate balance.  Whilst acknowledging historic and contemporary practices of slavery and the slave trade as morally outrageous, and something that would be a crime against humanity today, it did not apply that legal principle to an era before the principle actually existed.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;  One of the contentious points at the conference related to the issue was that of [[apartheid]].  During the preparatory processes of the conference, South Africa stressed that it did not want to link compensation to apartheid.  At the Tehran Regional Conference, a paragraph making such a link was inserted by Asian governments.  This was deleted at the request of the South African delegation.  Linking compensation to apartheid had the potential to polarize South African society, and produce the same effects as had the controversial [[land reform in Zimbabwe|land reform programmes in Zimbabwe]].  Domestic political pressures, and the aim of the South African government to foster reconciliation within the country, made South Africa's position difficult.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;  The issue of compensation was thus a complex one, that was exacerbated by the [[President of Senegal]], [[Abdoulaye Wade]], calling campaigns to demand compensation for colonialism and slavery &quot;childish&quot;.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;  The earliest point at which the issue of compensation caused problems was during preparations in May 2001, when delegations came to the decision of where to place it on the agenda.  At the time, the fourth item on the agenda, out of five items, was &quot;Provision of effective remedies, recourses, redress, compensatory, and other measures, at the national, regional, and international levels&quot;.  The European Union, represented by Portugal, wanted to place the entire language in brackets.  The United States just wanted to place the word &quot;compensatory&quot; in brackets.  The African Group, Armenia, and Cuba strongly objected to both proposals, with the African Group stating that if the topic were placed in brackets, they would move for the entire text to be placed in brackets also.  In the end, the U.S. proposal was adopted, with the addition of a statement in the report indicating the different perspectives on the exact meaning of those brackets.  Western European states discussed informally amongst themselves, outside of the formal preparatory proceedings, what measures and levels of non-cöoperation they might adopt if the issue of compensation gained momentum at Durban itself.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;  Before the conference, the debate over compensation was seen as dealing with the transatlantic slave trade, and the colonization of Africa by Europeans, thus pitting Western European states (including the former colonial powers of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom) and the United States against the African Group.  The African Group was supported by Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;  Prior to the conference, on [[2001-08-03]], the African Group circulated a Non-Paper on the &quot;Injustices of the Past&quot;, containing strong language but a generally reasonable position.  To this paper the E.U. responded, on [[2001-08-08]], with a Non-Paper of its own that addressed most, but not all, of the issues in the African Group's paper.  The United States circulated a Non-Paper as well, but this turned out to be less helpful than the E.U. one.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;  The African Group circulated a second Non-Paper on [[2001-09-03]] that was substantially stronger than its earlier one, with language shifts from &quot;debt cancellation&quot; to &quot;immediate and unconditional cancellation of debt&quot;, emphasis upon crimes against humanity, and calls for reparation (something which the earlier paper had not included in part because of a U.S. demand, made at a preparatory meeting in Geneva, that such language be excluded from the text).&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;  Several members of the African Group openly opposed calling for reparations.  President Wade stated &quot;We still suffer the effects of slavery and colonialism, and that cannot be evaluated in monetary terms.  I find that not only absurd, but insulting.&quot;.  Similarly, South Africa was more interested in devoting time and effort to more pragmatic ends, such as Western aid for the [[Millennium Africa Recovery Programme]], which would be more palatable to the U.S. and the E.U..&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;  A consensus on the reparations issue was reached by late August.  On [[2001-08-24]] President of the United States [[George W. Bush]] announced in a press conference that &quot;the reparations issue has been solved &amp;mdash; at least the last information I had was that the issue has … looks like it has been resolved&quot;, albeit that news media at the time failed to realize the significance of the comment.  The U.S. walked out of the conference a few weeks later.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;  === Zionism === ==== Draft text prior to the conference ==== During preparatory meetings in Geneva, text that linked [[Zionism]] to [[racism]] was placed in brackets, with the expectation that it would be replaced by text that referred to violations of the rights of Palestinians.  The U.S. had already threatened to boycott the conference should the conference draft documents include text that could be in any way interpreted as linking Zionism to racism.  [[Mary Robinson]] had also said that regional political conflicts should not be imposed upon the agenda of the conference.  The Australian, the Canadian, and some European delegations shared the U.S. view.&lt;ref name=Al-Ahram&gt;{{cite news|work=Al-Ahram Weekly Online|date=[[2001-08-09]]|issue=546|location=Cairo|publisher=AL-AHRAM|author=Dina Ezzat|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/546/fr2.htm|title=Reading between the brackets}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Arab position was stated by the Secretary General of the [[Arab League]], [[Amr Moussa]]: &quot;Israel's racist actions against the Palestinian people have to be dealt with in an international conference that aims to eradicate racism. Arab countries are not expecting the Durban conference to be a venue for dealing with the Arab- Israeli peace process, but they certainly expect that the Israeli racist practices against the Palestinian people will not be overlooked.&quot;&lt;ref name=Al-Ahram /&gt;  The Arab delegates were not insistent upon language that specifically equated Zionism with racism.  It had been suggested that they were trying to revive [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379]] (issued 1975, annulled 1991) which stated that &quot;Zionism is a form of racism.&quot;.  Their position was that they were, rather, trying to underline that the actions being committed by Israel against Palestinians were racist.&lt;ref name=Al-Ahram /&gt;  This stance was in part influenced by the U.S. threat of boycott, which would have made it impractical to insist upon harsh language condemning Israel or equating the suffering of the Palestinians with that of holocaust victims.  According to one Arab diplomat, no Arab state except for Syria had insisted upon any language linking Israel to racist practices.&lt;ref name=Al-Ahram /&gt;  At the start of the Geneva meeting, text had been presented that comprised six bracketed paragraphs dealing with &quot;Zionist racist practices&quot;, including an appeal for Israel &quot;to revise its legislation based on racial or religious discrimination such as the law of return and all the policies of an occupying power which prevent the Palestinian refugees and displaced persons from returning to their homes and properties&quot;, and a suggestion for the need &quot;to bring the foreign occupation of Jerusalem by Israel together with all its racist practices to an end&quot;.&lt;ref name=Al-Ahram /&gt;  By the end of the meeting, all of this text had either been removed or toned down.  One such phrase removed was a mention of &quot;holocausts&quot; suffered by other peoples, which had been seen as an affront to the memory of the Jewish victims of [[The Holocaust|the Nazi holocaust]].  South African diplomats had already told Arab and Muslim countries that they would have to offer text that could describe the current situation without using such language as &quot;ethnic cleansing practices against Palestinians&quot;.&lt;ref name=Al-Ahram /&gt;  Nonetheless, the United States, objecting to the remaining text, decided to send a low-level delegation, headed by Ambassador [[Michael Southwick]], to the Conference, rather than have [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] attend himself.  German officials criticized this decision, and the United States [[Congressional Black Caucus]] urged him to attend.  The [[Anti-Defamation League]] urged him to stay away.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;  ==== Withdrawal by U.S. and Israel ==== On [[2001-09-03]], after four days of deadlocked negotiations that did not reach agreement on language, the United States and Israeli delegations withdrew from the conference.  Both United States Secretary of State Colin Powell and [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel]] [[Shimon Peres]] stated that this was done with regret.&lt;ref name=Klusener&gt;{{cite news|title=Accusations Fly As US, Israel Walk Out Of &quot;Bizarre&quot; UN Conference|author=Mark Klusener|work=CNSNews.com|date=[[2001-09-04]]|url=http://www.cnsnews.com./ForeignBureaus%5Carchive%5C200109%5CFor20010904a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news|title=US abandons racism summit|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=[[2001-09-03]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1523600.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news|title=Racism summit turmoil: Reactions|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=[[2001-09-03]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1523830.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This decision was criticized by several people, including [[Jesse Jackson]] and [[President of South Africa]] [[Thabo Mbeki]], both of whom stated their opinions that it had been a mistake by the United States to send a low-level delegation to the conference in the first place, and [[Amnesty International]], which stated that the U.S. was &quot;letting down victims of racism&quot;.  Jackson had been involved in earlier attempts to create compromise language.&lt;ref name=Klusener /&gt;  The low-level U.S. delegation had kept a low profile throughout conference proceedings until that point, with delegates working quietly in sub-committee meetings, without (unlike in earlier conferences) giving news briefings or off the record statements to journalists, to change the text of the draft declaration, to make it less forceful and less specific against Israel, and to bring it into line with U.S. foreign policy goals with respect to the [[International Criminal Court]] (see [[United States and the International Criminal Court]]) by removing language that strengthened the ICC.&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel and United States storm out from Durban Conference, denouncing draft declaration as &quot;racist&quot;|author=Robert E. Sullivan|date=[[2002-09-25]]|work=The Earth Times|url=http://earthtimes.org./sep/thedurbanconferenceisraelsep4_01.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The draft documents had stated &quot;deep concern&quot; at the &quot;increase of racist practices of Zionism and anti-Semitism&quot; and talked of the emergence of &quot;movements based on racism and discriminatory ideas, in particular the Zionist movement, which is based on racial superiority&quot;.

Several reports had the Europeans staying on solely in order to help South Africa salvage the Conference.  After the withdrawal, senior conference officials became highly involved in the rewriting of the Declaration &amp;mdash; something that critics maintained they should have also been doing before that point.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;  ==== Final text and subsequent reaction ==== In the end, the Conference delegates voted to reject the language that implicitly accused Israel of racism, and the document actually published contained no such language.&lt;ref name=BBC4&gt;{{cite news|date=[[2001-09-08]]|title=Mixed emotions as Durban winds up|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1530976.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several countries were unhappy with the final text's approach to the subject, but all for different reasons.  Syria and Iran were unhappy because their demands for the language about racism and Israel had been rejected by the Conference, the latter continuing its insistence that Israel was a racist state.  Australia was unhappy with the process, observing that &quot;far too much of the time at the conference [had been] consumed by bitter divisive exchanges on issues which have done nothing to advance the cause of combating racism&quot;.  Canada was also unhappy.&lt;ref name=BBC4 /&gt;  The language of the final text was carefully drafted for balance.   The word &quot;diaspora&quot; is used four times, and solely to refer to the [[African Diaspora]].  The document is at pains to main a cohesive identity for everyone of African heritage as a victim of slavery, even including those who may have more European than African ancestors.  The &quot;victim&quot; or &quot;victims&quot; of racism and slavery (the two words occurring 90 times in the document) are defined in only the most general geographic terms.  The word &quot;Jewish&quot; is only used once, alongside &quot;Muslim&quot; and &quot;Arab&quot;, and &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; is only used twice, once alongside its assumed counterpart of &quot;Islamophobia&quot; and once alongside &quot;anti-Arabism&quot;.  The difficulty that this generates is that it is politically impossible to act when the 219 calls for action in the Programme are couched in such generalities that only the &quot;countless human beings&quot; that the document explicitly talks of can be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|pages=148|booktitle=Rhetorical Democracy: Discursive Practices of Civic Engagement &amp;mdash; Rhetoric Society of America Conference|editor=Gerard A.

This was a forum of [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]s.  It, too adopted a Declaration.  However, this was not an official document of the WCAR and was not issued as such.&lt;ref name=Hindu1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hindu.com./thehindu/2001/09/09/stories/05091344.htm|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=[[2001-09-09]]|title=The different shades of hatred}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UN1&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=[[United Nations]]|work=World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance|location=Durban|date=[[2001-09-05]]|title=DAILY PRESS BRIEFING|url=http://www.un.org./WCAR/pressreleases/db090501.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Forum's proceedings were highly disorganized, with several NGO delegates walking out of the Forum, to the jeers of other delegates, and ending in discord; and the resultant declaration had 62 paragraphs of introduction, followed by a document that appeared to commentators as being the result of every lobby putting its pet aversions in.  It described Israel as a &quot;racist, apartheid state&quot; that was guilty of &quot;racist crimes including war crimes, acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing&quot;.  The document was not intended to be presented to the Conference, although a copy of it was intended to be handed over, as a symbolic gesture, to the Conference secretary-general, Mary Robinson, at the conclusion of the Forum.  Ms Robinson refused to accept the document, citing concerns over its language.  In a later interview she said of the whole conference that &quot;there was horrible anti-Semitism present &amp;mdash; particularly in some of the NGO discussions. A number people came to me and said they've never been so hurt or so harassed or been so blatantly faced with an anti-Semitism.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hindu1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;&lt;ref name=UN1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC5&gt;{{cite news|date=[[2002-11-21]]|title=Mary Robinson, UN Human Rights chief|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/forum/1673034.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics described the description of [[Israel and the apartheid analogy|Israel as apartheid]] as the &quot;Durban Strategy&quot;.

The Forum also called upon the United States to ratify all major human rights treaties that had already been ratified.&lt;ref name=Fonte /&gt;  One such treaty was the UN [[Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD), which the U.S. had ratified in 1994, but (per the [[Supremacy Clause]] of [[Article Six of the United States Constitution]], which does not permit treaties to override the Constitution) had attached a reservation that its ratification did not accept treaty requirements that were incompatible with the [[Constitution of the United States]].  The NGOs, including [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], demanded that U.S. drop its reservations and &quot;comply&quot; with the treaty.  The U.S. Department of State had noted specifically that CERD's restrictions on [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly]] were incompatible with the [[First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]].  The United States was far from the only such country to do so, however.  Incompatibility of the treaty with national constitutions, including the freedoms of assembly and speech guaranteed by those constitutions, is also noted by Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, France, Guyana, Jamaica, Japan, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Switzerland, and Thailand.  Several, including France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malta, Moncao, Nepal, the United Kingdom, note that they consider the provisions of the treaty to be restricted by and subject to the freedoms of speech and assembly set forth in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Fonte /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org./english/bodies/ratification/2.htm#reservations|publisher=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]]|title=International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination &amp;mdash; Reservations|date=[[2007-07-18]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One commentator noted that in order to comply with the interpretation of CERD created by the NGOs at the Forum, the United States would have to &quot;turn its political and economic system, together with their underlying principles, upside down &amp;mdash; abandoning the free speech guarantees of the Constitution, bypassing federalism, and ignoring the very concept of majority rule, since practically nothing in the NGO agenda is supported by the [U.S.] electorate&quot;, stating that these NGOs were &quot;a new challenge to [[liberal democracy]]&quot; that contested the principles of individual rights, democratic representation, and national citizenship, along with the contesting the very idea of a liberal democratic nation-state.&lt;ref name=Fonte /&gt;  Other NGO demands included demands for:&lt;ref name=Fonte /&gt; * U.S. acknowledgement of &quot;the breadth and pervasiveness of institutional racism&quot; that &quot;permeates every institution at every level&quot; * a declaration that &quot;racial bias corrupts every stage of the [U.S.] criminal justice process, from suspicion fo investigation, arrest, prosecution, trial, and sentencing&quot; * support for and expansion of hate crimes legislation at both state and federal levels * U.S. condemnation of any opposition to [[affirmative action]] * U.S. recognition of an adequate standard of living as &quot;a right, not a privilege&quot; * a statement that the U.S. deplored the &quot;denial of economic rights&quot; * the promotion of multilingualism by the U.S. instead of &quot;discriminatory&quot; emphasis on English language acquisition in U.S. schools * the denunciation of [[free market]] [[capitalism]] as a &quot;fundamentally flawed system&quot;  Tom Lantos assigns the blame for the withdrawal of the U.S. in part to the radicalism of many of the NGOs at the NGO Forum, to an inadequate response thereto by U.S.-based NGOs, and to the reluctance of the U.S.'s European allies to take a strong stand.&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite book|title=The United States and the Rule of Law in International Affairs|author=John Francis Murphy|pages=326&amp;ndash;328|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|id=ISBN 0521529689}}&lt;/ref&gt;  == Aftermath == The Conference was largely overshadowed in the news and in international affairs by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], which occurred 3 days after the Conference ended.    === Mary Robinson's tenure as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights === As a consequence of the Conference, the United States did not support the continuation of Mary Robinson as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, where once U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] had called her a &quot;spendid choice&quot; for the post and the U.S. had considered her its favourite candidate for the job.  She stepped down from the post in September 2002.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;  Many faults were attributed to Ms Robinson, with cumulative effect on the U.S. position.  Some people stated that she lacked mediation and bureaucratic experience, and thus was unable to resolve sensitive issues at the Conference.  News reports attributed her differences with the U.S. to four things:  First, her views on the [[Israel-Palestine conflict]] differed from U.S. policy.  Second, the U.S. did not approve of the detached way in which she acted as secretary-general to the Conference.  Third, she had openly criticized the U.S. on various matters including the treatment of prisoners at [[Camp X-Ray]], the &quot;unsigning&quot; of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] by the U.S., and the administration of [[capital punishment in the United States]].  Fourth, she had opposed U.S. calls to reform the election process of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;  Tom Lantos himself did not assign sole or even primary blame to Robinson for the breakdown of U.S. relations with the conference.  That he assigned to the NGOs, as aforementioned, and to the member states of the [[Organization of the Islamic Conference]].  Moreover, several people have defended Robinson's secretary-generalship of the conference.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;  === NGO repudiations of the NGO Forum's Declaration === Several NGOs, including [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Amnesty International]], and the [[Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights]], disassociated themselves from the language of the NGO Forum's Declaration that dealt with Israel and with Jews.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;  === Followups === It seems unlikely to analysts that the United States will support another WCAR.  However, the Declaration and Programme of Action did make provision for follow-up mechanisms.  Mary Robinson stated in her closing address that the Conference was intended to be a beginning, not an end.  Dr. [[Manning Marable]], of [[Columbia University in New York]], pointed out that one of the objectives of the Conference was to increase coördination in human rights activities, and to strengthen networks amongst those combating racism; and as such the actions of governments in response to the Conference are not the sole intended outcomes &amp;mdash; actions by civil society and non-governmental agencies are also required.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.columbia.edu./cu/news/01/08/UN_conference.html|publisher=[[Columbia University in New York]]|author=James Devitt|date=[[2001-08-15]]|title=Manning Marable to Address U.N. World Conference against Racism}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One such follow up provision is for national governments to provide the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights with reports on their actions towards implementing the recommendations in the Programme of Action.  Another is for the [[Secretary General of the United Nations]] to appoint an expert body with the remit of following up on implementation.  A third is a call for the establishment of a database of practical means for addressing racism, racial discrimination, and related intolerance.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;  One thing that is not a part of the Programme of Action is a formal accord on a [[+5 review]] conference.  By resolution #2002/68 of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] an Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action was established, which held its first meeting in January 2003 and which meets on an annual basis.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;  ===Influence===  The [[Institute for Global Jewish Affairs]] was founded, in part, as a response to the [[Anti-Semitism]] of the Durban conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/showpage.asp?DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=84&amp;FID=588&amp;PID=2274]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]] credits the conference with being one of the inspirations for his book, [[Left in Dark Times: A Stand Against the New Barbarism]]. &lt;ref&gt;The God That Failed: 'Left in Dark Times,'  By ADAM KIRSCH, September 10, 2008[http://www.nysun.com/arts/the-god-that-failed-left-in-dark-times-by-bernard/85499/]&lt;/ref&gt;  ==References== &lt;references/&gt; == Further reading == === Conference and Forum texts and papers === * {{cite conference|url=http://www.un.org./WCAR/durban.pdf|format=PDF|booktitle=World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance|title=Declaration|date=[[2002-01-02]]|publisher=[[United Nations]]}} &amp;mdash; the text of the Declaration produced by the governments at the WCAR itself * {{cite book|title=Declaration and Programme of Action: As Adopted at Kingsmead Cricket Stadium, Durban, South Africa, 3 September 2001|location=Johannesburg|author=Charles Pillai|year=2002|publisher=World Conference Against Racism, NGO Forum Secretariat|id=ISBN 0620289724}} &amp;mdash; the text of the Declaration produced by the NGOs at the NGO Forum * {{cite conference|booktitle=World Conference against Racism 2001|title=Structural Racism and American Democracy: Historical and Theoretical Perspectives|author=[[Manning Marable]]|publisher=[[United Nations Research Institute for Social Development]]|date=[[2002-06-12]]|format=PDF|url=http://www.unrisd.org/UNRISD/website/document.nsf/d2a23ad2d50cb2a280256eb300385855/4dac9ff0a00c10f680256b6d0057879c/$FILE/dmarable.pdf}} === Analyses and greater detail === * {{cite paper|author=[[Mary Robinson]]|title=Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and Followup to the World Conference of Human Rights|date=[[2002-02-27]]|publisher=[[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]]|id=E/CN.4/2002/18|url=http://daccessdds.un.org./doc/UNDOC/GEN/G02/110/21/PDF/G0211021.pdf|format=PDF}} * {{cite news|date=[[2004-09-03]]|title=From Durban to Beersheba|author=Abraham Cooper and Harold Brackman|work=The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=12758}} * {{cite journal|title=The Centrality of NGOs in The Durban Strategy|author=Gerald M.

It is the largest species, reaching lengths of {{convert|50|mm|in}}. This species is distributed throughout the eastern portion of the [[Guiana|Guiana Shield]], including parts of [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[Brazil]], and nearly all of [[French Guiana]].  ==Distribution== It exists in discrete patches throughout this region, being restricted to &quot;highland&quot; (up to {{convert|350|m|mi}}) areas. While this species can be found at sea level, these individuals have been collected at the base of nearby hills or mountains. The isolation of populations has presumably occurred as a result of the erosion of these highland areas and the seasonal inundation of the inter-patch areas.  ==Morphs== [[Image:Drzewolaz malarski Dendrobates tinctorius regina RB1.jpg|thumb|125px|left|''Dendrobates tinctorius regina'' morph.]] The species encompasses a great diversity of color and patterning variants ([[subspecies]] and [[morph]]s).

It is one of Hancock's first departures from the traditional idioms of jazz as well as the onset of a new, cretive and original style which produced an appeal to a wider audience, before his 1973 album, ''[[Head Hunters]]''. In addition, Mwandishi was [[Hancock]]'s attempt at continuing the musical principles and styles he began playing with [[Miles Davis]] on ''[[In A Silent Way]]''.  [[Hancock]]'s previous attempts at [[jazz-rock fusion]] included ''[[Fat Albert Rotunda]]'', an album conceived solely for [[Bill Cosby]]'s [[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]].  ''Mwandishi'' was principally recorded at the [[Van Gelder Studio]] in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey between October 4 and December 8, 1969, and Wally Heider Recording Studios, San Francisco, California on December 31, 1969. It was originally recorded by the Mwandishi Sextet that was built around Herbie Hancock and progressive notions of funk, jazz, and rock during this time period.  The tracks on ''Mwandishi'' are &quot;Ostinato,&quot; which is in 15/4 rhythm, &quot;You'll Know When You Get There&quot;, and &quot;Wandering Spirit Song&quot;.  &quot;Wandering Spirit Song&quot; features Hancock's extensive use of tension and release, whereby he builds the tension of the song by increasing the amount of musical voices and increasing crescendos, only to release the tension with long held out chords on his [[synthesizer]].  ''Mwandishi'' is a Swahili name Hancock adopted during the late 1960s and early 1970s. The members of the Sextet each adopted a Swahili name: Mchezaji/[[Buster Williams]], Jabali/[[Billy Hart]], Mganga/[[Eddie Henderson]], Mwile/[[Bennie Maupin]], Pepo Mtoto/[[Julian Priester]], and Ndugu/[[Leon 'Ndugu' Chancler|Leon Chancler]].  ==Track listing== #&quot;Ostinato (Suite For [[Angela Davis|Angela]])&quot; – 13:10 #&quot;You'll Know When You Get There&quot; – 10:22 #&quot;Wandering Spirit Song&quot; – 21:26  ==Personnel== * [[Herbie Hancock|Mwandishi / Herbie Hancock]] – [[Rhodes piano|Fender Rhodes piano]] * [[Buster Williams|Mchezaji / Buster Williams]] – [[bass guitar|Bass]] * [[Billy Hart|Jabali / Billy Hart]] – [[drum kit|Drums]] * [[Eddie Henderson|Mganga / Eddie Henderson]] – [[Trumpet]], [[flugelhorn]] * [[Bennie Maupin|Mwile / Bennie Maupin]] – [[Bass clarinet]], [[alto flute]], [[piccolo]] * [[Julian Priester|Pepo Mtoto / Julian Priester]] – [[tenor trombone]],[[bass trombone]] ''with'' *[[Ronnie Montrose]] – Guitar on &quot;Ostinato (Suite For Angela) * [[Leon 'Ndugu' Chancler]] – [[drum kit|drums]] and [[percussion instrument|percussion]] * [[Jose Areas|Cepito / Jose Areas]] – [[congas]] and [[Timbales]] * [[Sandra Stevens]] – vocals * [[Joe Farrell]] – [[alto and tenor saxophone]] * [[Joe Henderson]] – [[tenor saxophone]], [[alto flute]] * [[Johnny Coles]] – [[trumpet]], [[flugelhorn]] * [[Joe Newman]] – [[trumpet]] * [[Ray Alonge]] – [[French horn]] * [[Eric Gale]] – [[electric guitar]] * [[Jerry Jermott]] – [[bass guitar|electric bass]]  [[Category:1970 albums]] [[Category:Herbie Hancock albums]] [[Category:Jazz albums]] [[Category:Warner Bros.

IPA: /{{IPA|pɐɾ.'ti.ðu ʁɛ.pu.βli.'kɐ.nu puɾ.tu.'ɣeʃ}}/), was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[left-wing]] [[political party]] during the [[Portuguese First Republic]]. It was also the self-proclaimed successor to the original [[Portuguese Republican Party]], which had been behind the [[5 October 1910 revolution|revolution]] that established the Portuguese First Republic in 1910.  The name &quot;Democratic Party&quot; was never the official name of the party, as the Portuguese Republican Party never ceased to exist. However, the party was ''de facto'' different and thus the other parties (that belonged to the PRP before 1910) used the new expression to assert their opposition to the claim of continuation of the PRP by [[Afonso Costa]], the first leader of the Democratic Party. Other names were given to the members of the Democratic Party, like the Afonsists, named after [[Afonso Costa]].  ==History== When the [[Evolutionist Republican Party|Evolutionists]] and [[Republican Union Party (Portugal)|Unionists]] seceded from the Portuguese Republican Party in February 1912, the Democratic Party declared itself the latter party's heir. It soon controlled its electoral and propagandistic structure, a fact that would influence the dominance of the Democratic Party during the First Republic.  During the First Republic, the Democratic Party, led by [[Afonso Costa]], managed to hold power despite suffering several revolutionary attempts, both [[Monarchism|monarchist]] and [[Republicanism|republican]]. Although some of the coups partially succeeded ([[Monarchy of the North]], [[Pimenta de Castro]], [[Sidónio Pais]]) the Democratic Party always managed to retain power.  During [[World War I]], in which [[Portugal in the Great War|Portugal participated]], the party entered a [[coalition government]] with the [[Evolutionist Party]] called &quot;[[União Sagrada|Sacred Union]]&quot;, to face the problems of the war. Following the war, discontent grew and the union was eventually dissolved. Sidónio took advantage of this and established a dictatorial government of his [[National Republican Party]]. Sidónio Pais was assassinated in 1917. By 1919 the Democratic Party was again in power.  After 1919, with Afonso Costa in Paris, the party was led by [[António Maria da Silva]]. In the next phase of the party's existence, political, popular and [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] opposition created a climate of constant revolt. Groups also seceded from the party, with the creation of the [[Republican Party of the Democratic Left-Wing]] and the [[Reformist Party]], both on the Left.  ==Relations with the Republic Party== The identification of the First Republic with the Democratic Party was so close, as the party dominated all political life between 1911 and 1926, that [[Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa]] described it as a &quot;[[multi-party system]] with a dominant party&quot; and historian [[Fernando Rosas]] called it a &quot;political monopoly&quot; and a &quot;democratic dictatorship&quot;.  ==Prime Ministers== * [[Augusto de Vasconcelos]] (1911-1912) * [[Duarte Leite]] (1912-1913) * [[Afonso Costa]] (1913-1914; 1915-1916; 1917 - in coalition with the evolutionists [Sacred Union]) * [[Bernardino Machado]] (1914; 1921) * [[Victor Hugo de Azevedo Coutinho]] (1914-1915) * [[António José de Almeida]] - Evolutionist in coalition (Sacred Union) - (1916-1917) * [[José Relvas]] (1919) * [[Domingos Pereira]] (1919; 1920; 1925) * [[Alfredo de Sá Cardoso]] (1919-1920; 1920) * [[António Maria Baptista]] (1920) * [[José Ramos Preto]] (1920) * [[António Maria da Silva]] (1920; 1922-1923; 1925; 1925-1926) * [[Liberato Pinto]] (1920-1921) * [[Alfredo Rodrigues Gaspar]] (1924) * [[Vitorino Guimarães]] (1925)  ==Presidents of Republic== * [[Manuel de Arriaga]] (1911-1915)  * [[Teófilo Braga]] (1915)  * [[Bernardino Machado]] (1915-1918; 1925-1926)  * [[Manuel Teixeira Gomes]] (1923-1925)  ==See also== *[[Politics of Portugal]] *[[History of Portugal]] **[[History of Portugal (1834-1910)]] **[[History of Portugal (1910-1926)]] **[[History of Portugal (1926-1974)]] **[[5 October 1910 revolution]] **[[28 May 1926 revolution]] *[[Timeline of Portuguese history]] **[[Timeline of Portuguese history (First Republic)]] *[[List of political parties in Portugal]] *[[List of Presidents of Portugal]] *[[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal]]  [[Category:Political parties in Portugal|Democratic Party (Portugal)]]  [[de:Partido Democrático]] [[pl:Partia Demokratyczna (Portugalia)]] [[pt:Partido Democrático (Portugal)]]</text>     </revision>

Example: -[[OH]] , - [[NH2]] , [[Aldehydes]].  An auxochrome is a functional group of atoms with nonbonded electrons which, when attached to a chromophore, alters both the wavelength and intensity of absorption. If these groups are in direct conjugation with the pi-system of the chromophore, they may increase the wavelength at which the light is absorbed and as a result intensify the absorption. A feature of these auxochromes is the presence of at least one lone pair of electrons which can be viewed as extending the conjugated system by resonance.   It increases the color of any organic compound. For example, Benzene cant develop color as it doesnt have any chromophore but Nitro benzene is pale yellow color because of the presence of nitro compound. But when it is para-hydroxynitro benzene, the color is deep yellow. Here an auxochrome (-OH) is conjugated with the chromophore -NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This is why the color is more developed. Same case happens in Azo benzene (Red color)but para-hydroxy azobenzene is dark red color.  There are mainly two types of auxochromes-   1. Acidic  -COOH, -OH, -SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H 2. Basic   -NHR, -NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, -NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  {{physics-stub}}  [[de:Auxochrom]] [[fr:Auxochrome]] [[sr:Ауксохроми]] [[uk:Ауксохроми]]</text>     </revision>

It featured Belle running a book and music shop, visited by local children to whom Belle would tell (and sing) stories, usually with a moral that fit a situation happening in the shop or with the children.  The opening credits featured a mix of animation and live action (specifically inserting the live-action Belle into animation from the &quot;Belle&quot; musical sequence in ''Beauty and the Beast'').  Often classic Disney short films, such as [[Pecos Bill]] and [[The Brave Little Tailor]] were used to illustrate the stories.  Actors portraying her father Maurice and [[Gaston (Beauty and the Beast)|Gaston]] also occasionally  appeared. The actress for Belle herself was [[California]] native Lynsey McLeod.  The [[television series]] was produced by [[Walt Disney Television]], and aired from [[1995]] to [[1999]].

It does not contain any original Fish material; instead it is a [[Cover_album#Tributes.2C_tribute_albums_and_cover_albums|cover album]] featuring Fish's versions of songs by artists who inspired him before his career started. The choice of songs by [[Pink Floyd]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[David Bowie]], [[The Moody Blues]] and others, all originally from a period between 1970 and 1976, reflects Fish's taste in music when he was 12 to 18 years old. The title is a reference to the time when he would impersonate his teenage idols in front of a mirror. Fish's idea to make a cover album dates back to the late [[Marillion]] period, but had been rejected by the band.  Overall, the album was not received favourably. It appeared out of touch with the dominant musical trends of the early 1990s, diminishing its appeal to the general audience. At the same time, fans were waiting for new original material. Also, most younger fans found the songs difficult to relate to and too different from Fish's own work. As a result, the album turned out a to be commercial failure. [[Polydor]], already disappointed with the sales of [[Internal Exile]] (1991), had initially rejected Fish's idea of a cover album, but eventually accepted it as the second album Fish was obliged to deliver under their contract. However, they dropped Fish within two months of the album's release. As of February 2008, ''Songs from the Mirror'' is Fish's last ever output on a major record company.  ==Musicians== The core line-up on this album is the same as on the 1992 tour. Since the recording of [[Internal Exile]], keyboardist [[Mickey Simmonds]] had been replaced with [[Foster Paterson]], while drummer [[Kevin Wilkinson]] had taken over from session player [[Ethan Johns]]. The spots for guitars ([[Robin Boult]], [[Frank Usher]]) and bass ([[David Paton]]) had remained unchanged. Other than that and backing vocals, only two tracks (&quot;Solo&quot; and &quot;Jeepster&quot;) feature an additional guest musician, [[Ben Molleson]] on [[violin]] and [[tin whistle]]. The album was mixed and produced by [[James Cassidy (producer)|James Cassidy]], who Fish had met while recording guest vocals for [[Jeff Wayne]]'s musical [[Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of Spartacus|Spartacus]]. Cassidy would also produce and co-write Fish's next album [[Suits (album)|Suits]] (1994).  ==Single release== Only a [[lead single]] was released from this album, with [[Argent (band)|Argent]]'s 1972 hit &quot;Hold Your Head Up&quot; as the [[A-Side]].  This was actually marketed as an [[Extended Play|EP]] entitled ''Never Mind The Bullocks (featuring Hold Your Head Up)'', somewhat fraudulently as the 7&quot; and CD single only contained two and three songs respectively. Also, these songs were to be found on the album, providing little incentive for fans to purchase the single. A second single with [[David Bowie]]'s [[Five Years]] as the A-Side was in the pipeline, but never officially released; only a radio [[Promotional recording|promo]] exists.  ==Cover art== ''Songs from the Mirror'' is the only regular Fish album not to be designed by [[Mark Wilkinson]]. Fish had deliberately decided to not use Wilkinson, as he didn't want to give the impression it was an album with original material. Instead, he chose the &quot;The Guddler&quot; by Scottish painter [[Keith McIntyre]] as the cover. &quot;The Guddler&quot; had also been the working title of the project.  ==Tour== The album was followed by a tour, which was significantly longer than the previous tour promoting ''Internal Exile''.  After the 1992 &quot;Toile Tour&quot; in club-sized venues, this tour saw Fish return to large-capacity halls. However, this was also the last time he regularly played such venues. The stage design initially featured 'nets' which separated the band from Fish. Some found this somewhat egotistical while others saw that it allowed Fish to interact with the audience and heighten the sense of atmosphere. However after morale began to fall in the band, Fish finally decided to get rid of the nets and resumed with his normal stage set up. The double live album [[Sushi (album)|Sushi]] (1994) was recorded during this tour and features five ''Songs from the Mirror''.  ==Re-releases== After Fish signed with [[Roadrunner Records]] in 1998, ''Songs from the Mirror'' was re-released on this label along with the other studio albums from his backcatalogue. The re-issue featured a changed track-list: [[Jeepster (song)|Jeepster]] was removed, two other cover versions were added, [[The Seeker (song)|The Seeker]] by [[The Who]] and &quot;Time and A Word&quot; by [[Yes (band)]], which had previously been released on the compilation [[Outpatients '93]]. &quot;Time and A Word&quot; was also part of the compilation [[Yin and Yang (Fish albums)|Yin]] (1995).  ==Track listing== #&quot;[[Question (song)|Question]]&quot; – 06:41 ([[Justin Hayward|Hayward]]) ([[The Moody Blues]], from [[A Question of Balance]], 1970) #&quot;Boston Tea Party&quot; – 04:22 ([[Alex Harvey|Harvey]]/[[Hugh McKenna|McKenna]]/[[Zal Cleminson|Cleminson]]) ([[Sensational Alex Harvey Band]], from [[SAHB Stories (SAHB album)|SAHB Stories]], 1976) #&quot;[[Fearless (song)|Fearless]]&quot; – 06:15 ([[David Gilmour|Gilmour]]/[[Nick Mason|Mason]]/[[Roger Waters|Waters]]/[[Richard Wright (musician)|Wright]]) ([[Pink Floyd]], from [[Meddle]], 1971) #&quot;[[Apeman (song)|Apeman]]&quot; – 05:57 ([[Ray Davies|Davies]]) ([[The Kinks]], from [[Lola versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One]], 1970) #&quot;Hold Your Head Up&quot; – 03:47 ([[Rod Argent|Argent]]/[[Chris White (musician)|White]]) ([[Argent (band)|Argent]], from [[All Together Now (album)|All Together Now]], 1972) #&quot;Solo&quot; – 04:46 ([[Sandy Denny|Denny]]) (Sandy Denny, from [[Like an Old Fashioned Waltz]], 1974) #&quot;[[I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)|I Know What I Like]]&quot; – 04:17 ([[Tony Banks (musician)|Banks]]/[[Phil Collins|Collins]]/[[Peter Gabriel|Gabriel]]/[[Steve Hackett|Hackett]]/[[Mike Rutherford|Rutherford]]) ([[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], from [[Selling England by the Pound]], 1973) #&quot;[[Jeepster (song)|Jeepster]]&quot; – 04:10 ([[Marc Bolan|Bolan]]) ([[T.Rex (band)|T-Rex]], from [[Electric Warrior]], 1971) &lt;small&gt;cancelled from the remastered edition&lt;/small&gt; #&quot;[[Five Years]]&quot; – 05:19 ([[David Bowie|Bowie]]) (David Bowie, from [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]], 1972) Total Time 44:53  ===Remastered edition=== #&quot;[[Question (song)|Question]]&quot; – 06:41 ([[Justin Hayward|Hayward]]) ([[The Moody Blues]], from [[A Question of Balance]], 1970) #&quot;Boston Tea Party&quot; – 04:22 ([[Alex Harvey|Harvey]]/[[Hugh McKenna|McKenna]]/[[Zal Cleminson|Cleminson]]) ([[Sensational Alex Harvey Band]], from [[SAHB Stories (SAHB album)|SAHB Stories]], 1976) #&quot;[[Fearless (song)|Fearless]]&quot; – 06:15 ([[David Gilmour|Gilmour]]/[[Nick Mason|Mason]]/[[Roger Waters|Waters]]/[[Richard Wright (musician)|Wright]]) ([[Pink Floyd]], from [[Meddle]], 1971) #&quot;[[Apeman (song)|Apeman]]&quot; – 05:57 ([[Ray Davies|Davies]]) ([[The Kinks]], from [[Lola versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One]], 1970) #&quot;Hold Your Head Up&quot; – 03:47 ([[Rod Argent|Argent]]/[[Chris White (musician)|White]]) ([[Argent (band)|Argent]], from [[All Together Now (album)|All Together Now]], 1972) #&quot;[[I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)|I Know What I Like]]&quot; – 04:17 ([[Tony Banks (musician)|Banks]]/[[Phil Collins|Collins]]/[[Peter Gabriel|Gabriel]]/[[Steve Hackett|Hackett]]/[[Mike Rutherford|Rutherford]]) ([[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], from [[Selling England by the Pound]], 1973) #&quot;Solo&quot; – 04:46 ([[Sandy Denny|Denny]]) (Sandy Denny, from [[Like an Old Fashioned Waltz]], 1974) #&quot;Time and a Word&quot; – 4.24 ([[Jon Anderson|Anderson]]/[[David Foster|Foster]] ([[Yes (band)|Yes]], from [[Time and a Word]], 1970) &lt;small&gt;bonus track&lt;/small&gt; #&quot;[[The Seeker (song)|The Seeker]]&quot; – 3.16 ([[Pete Townshend|Townshend]]) ([[The Who]], from [[Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy]], 1971) &lt;small&gt;bonus track&lt;/small&gt; #&quot;[[Five Years]]&quot; – 05:19 ([[David Bowie|Bowie]]) (David Bowie, from [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]], 1972)  ==External links== *[http://www.the-company.com/disco/dasftm.htm Discography entry on the official Fish site] *[http://www.the-company.com/email/stmirror.htm Fish's sleeve notes for the remastered edition]  [[Category:1993 albums]] [[Category:Fish albums]] [[Category:Covers albums]]  {{Template:Fish}}  [[it:Songs from the Mirror]]</text>     </revision>

It includes the following divisions: :*Cost Analysis and Research Division (CARD) :*Information Technology and Systems Division (ITSD) :*Intelligence Analysis Division (IAD) :*Joint Advanced Warfighting Division (JAWD) :*Operational Evaluation Division (OED) :*Science and Technology Division (STD) :*Strategy, Forces and Resources Division (SFRD) :*System Evaluation Division (SED)  The Science and Technology Policy Institute (STPI) supports the White House [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]]. It is located in [[Washington, DC]].  The IDA Center for Communications and Computing supports the [[National Security Agency]].  == Work == IDA's work is primarily in producing studies and analyses for the [[federal government of the United States]] on defense and scientific issues. IDA works only on projects sponsored by the U.S. federal government. Most of IDA's Studies and Analyses Center's work supports the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], though additional studies have been done for the [[Department of Homeland Security]], the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other [[government agency|agencies]] and [[offices]].  == Staff == IDA employs more than 1,300 research, professional, adjunct, and support staff. Its primary locations, all in the United States, are: :*Alexandria, Virginia :*Washington, DC :*Bowie, Maryland :*Princeton, New Jersey :*La Jolla, California  IDA's staff comprises [[research]] staff and [[Administration (business)|administrative]] staff. As of December 2006, the IDA Studies and Analses FFRDC research staff had the following characteristics: :Degrees: :*[[Doctoral]]: 60% :*[[Master's]]: 31% :*[[Bachelor's]]: 9% :Discipline: :*[[Math]], [[Statistics]], or [[Operations Research]]: 24% :*[[Engineering]]: 22% :*[[Physical Sciences]] or [[Life Sciences]]: 20% :*[[Economics]], [[Social Sciences]], or [[Political Science]]: 16% :*[[Computer Science]]: 10% :*[[Business Administration]]/[[Management]] or [[Humanities]]: 8%  As early as 2002, the President of IDA, Retired U.S. Air Force General Larry Welch, was being paid an annual salary of $323,979, according to IDA’s Form 990 for the year beginning Sept. 29, 2001 and ending Sept. 27, 2002.  At least ten other IDA executives were also paid annual salaries of over $140,000 in 2002. For instance, the IDA Vice-President for Administration and Finance, Ruth Greenstein, was paid an annual salary of $261,212, while the IDA Vice-President for Planning and Evaluation was paid $212,554. Annual salaries of between $196,889 and $231,076 were also paid to the directors of IDA’s five weapons research divisions in 2002.  In addition, the chairman of the IDA board of trustees, former University of South Carolina President John Palms, was paid an additional $27,100 in 2002 by IDA for his work as IDA board chairman. MIT Professor Sheila Widnall, a former Clinton Administration Secretary of the Air Force, also was paid an additional $10,800 in 2002 by IDA for apparently representing MIT on IDA’s board of trustees in 2002.  Although IDA is a non-profit, from its Pentagon weapons research contracts in 2002 it earned total revenues of $145 million that were $4 million more than the $141 million it had to spend on its weapons research think-tank activity.  These funds are spent on internally-initiated research projects.  According to IDA’s 2006 Annual Report, between 1996 and 2006, “Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom was examined” by IDA researchers “for lessons for future joint military operations and for operational test and evaluation programs.”  == Other Information == In order to preserve its impartiality, IDA maintains a low profile and minimizes contact with the press.  However, IDA's status as a defense-related organization has sparked controversy, most notably during the [[Columbia University protests of 1968]].  == External links == *[http://www.ida.org Institute for Defense Analyses] *[http://www.ida.org/stpi/index.html Science and Technology Policy Institute] [[Category:Think tanks based in the United States]] [[Category:Non-profit organizations based in Virginia]] [[Category:Research institutes in the United States]] [[Category:1956 establishments]]  [[de:Institute for Defense Analyses]]</text>     </revision>

Expanded to 3067 hectares in 1995, the park was originally created in 1940 to preserve and promote a feature known as the [[Painted Chasm]], or simply The Chasm, a [[gorge]] created from melting glacial waters eroding a [[volcanic plateau|lava plateau]] over a 10 million year span called the [[Chilcotin Plateau Basalts]].  The walls of the Chasm contain tones of red, brown yellow, and purple and are an average of 300 metres in height.  The Chasm is approximately 600 metres wide and 8 km long, and lies adjacent to the route of the [[Cariboo Road]], which limns the northern apex of the Chasm alongside the [[Canadian National Railway]] line.  In addition to the park upland areas of ponderosa pine, marshes and lakes are included in the park's boundaries.  ==Wildlife==  Bighorn Sheep, moose, mule deer, black bear, coyote, small mammals, songbirds and birds of prey.  ==External links== *[http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/chasm.html#parkinfo BC Parks info site] *[http://www.telemark.net/%7Erandallg/photos/20061021_Kamloops/images/121.jpg Aerial view of The Chasm]  ==See also== *[[Chilcotin Plateau Basalts]]   {{BritishColumbia-park-stub}} [[Category:Provincial Parks of British Columbia]] [[Category:Canyons and gorges of British Columbia]] [[Category:Cariboo Country]] [[Category:Bonaparte Country]] [[Category:Thompson-Nicola Regional District]]</text>     </revision>

In the press, it was highly praised for its exceptionally good quality sounds and realism.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  ==Tracks== In addition to the officially released tracks, the game supports many add-on tracks provided by the sim racing community.  * [[Scandinavian Raceway|Anderstorp]] GP * [[Scandinavian Raceway|Anderstorp]] North * [[Scandinavian Raceway|Anderstorp]] South * [[Dijon-Prenois]] GP * [[Dijon-Prenois]] Short * [[Donington Park|Donington]] GP * [[Donington Park|Donington]] National * [[Hockenheimring|Hockenheim]] GP * [[Hockenheimring|Hockenheim]] National * [[Hockenheimring|Hockenheim]] Short * [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari|Imola]] GP * [[Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours|Magny-Cours]] Club * [[Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours|Magny-Cours]] GP * [[Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours|Magny-Cours]] National * [[Mondello Park]] Intermediate * [[Mondello Park]] International * [[Mondello Park]] National * [[Mondello Park]] Short * [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] GP * [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] Junior * [[Nürburgring]] GP * [[Nürburgring]] Müllenbach * [[Nürburgring]] Sprint * [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]] GP * [[Zolder]]  ==External links== *[http://www.gt-legends.com/ GT Legends Official website]  {{SimBin games}}  [[Category:2005 video games]] [[Category:Racing simulators]] [[Category:Racing video games]] [[Category:SimBin Studios games]]  [[de:GT Legends]]</text>     </revision>

Empress Matilda conferred upon him the title Earl of Somerset, in 1141. In the foundation charter of the priory at Bruton he describes himself as &quot;Willielmus de Moyne, comes Somersetensis&quot;. The title was not recognised by Stephen or [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], Matilda's son, and his descendants did not use the title.

It's not right for FAC yet. [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] | [[User talk:Bishonen|ノート]] 18:45, 26 February 2006 (UTC). *'''Object'''. No references, neither well-written nor comprehensive (it's barely past stub size), needs to be brought into line with Wikipedia's [[WP:MOS|manual of style]] (as well as [[WP:MUSIC]] and [[WP:SONG]] guidelines), lead section is too short, description page for [[:Image:Wikimage 1.jpg]] contains vague copyright information.

After deleting a long rant about people who bring forth FA nominations without seeming to have any idea what an FA entails in the name of [[WP:CIVIL|civility]], I will instead direct the nominator to &quot;[[Cool (song)|Cool]]&quot; as an example to follow for how to make a featured article on a contemporary hit song. I would also strongly recommend the nominator withdraw the nomination ASAP (as happened recently with [[Big Sur]], which was much further along but needed work as its nominator soon realized) and get to work on the article.

In [[2003]] a major chunk of former Congressmen joined BJP, and formed a government in the state. BJP was for the first time a strong force in the state, and contested both seats. Congress had an alliance with its splinter-group [[Arunachal Congress]]. Congress candidate and former Arunachal Congress leader Wangcha Rajkumar contested Arunchal East and AC candidate Kamen Ringu contested Arunachal West. [[Nationalist Trinamool Congress]] (evolved out of Sangma wing of NCP in the state, a member of NDA) had a candidate in Arunachal West, competing against BJP. BJP won both seats with comfortable margins.  Polling took place in the state overshadowed by a boycott call from [[All Arunachal Pradesh Students Union]] over the inclusion of [[Chakma]] and [[Hajong]] refugees in the voters lists.   {| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;&gt; &lt;tr bgcolor=&quot;#cccccc&quot;&gt; !

Photo by Jill Furmanovsky]] Dylan Howe grew up in [[Hampstead]], [[London]].  He is the son of guitarist [[Steve Howe (guitarist)|Steve Howe]] (of [[Yes (band)|Yes]])—his father named him after [[Dylan Thomas]]. The guitar instrumental ''&quot;[[Clap]]&quot;'' was written for Dylan.  [[Image:SHTrio1.jpg|thumb|Steve Howe Trio - [[Bloomsbury Theatre]] April 2007. Photo by Yumi Hari]]Howe attended King Alfred School (KAS) from 1975 to 1986. He started playing aged 10 and is mainly self-taught. He studied for a small period of time with UK teaching great Bob Armstrong and had a few afternoons tuition in the early 1990's with [[Bill Bruford]] (who worked with his father in [[Yes (band)|Yes]]) and [[Jonathan Mover]].  Throughout 1977 Dylan lived with his family in Montreux, Switzerland whilst his father recorded the Yes album Going For The One . It was during this time Dylan first went to the Montreux jazz festival.  When Dylan was 13 his parents took him to see Buddy Rich and his big band at Ronnie Scott's club, he cites this as the moment when he knew that he wanted to become a jazz drummer.   Throughout his teens DH played in various groups with classmates from KAS and surrounding schools in North London. His first gigs were at KAS (1981) and UCS (1982) schools in Hampstead. The groups repertoires mainly consisted of covers of Clash, Bowie, Bauhaus and U2 songs, with a few original compositions. Dylan left KAS with three O' level passes in 1986. He worked as a window cleaner and sales assistant in various shops (Katherine Hamnett and others) until 1988 when he started working as a musician professionally.    In 1989 Dylan briefly ran nights at (now defunct) jazz club The Shack on Tisbury Court, Soho and started playing regularly at West End jam session/house band club nights at: The Limelight, Upstairs at Heaven and The Orange, West Kensington (where he played most Monday nights until the mid-nineties). DH also joined flautist and Jazz Warrior Philip Bent's group for a short stint at this time.  In 1996, Howe joined the house band for the [[Channel 4]] light entertainment series ''[[Light Lunch]]'' and its subsequent spin-off ''Late Lunch'', presented by comediennes [[Mel and Sue]].  He joined [[Ian Dury]] and the Blockheads in 1997 and has continued playing in [[The Blockheads]] since Dury's death.  Dylan has worked on several projects with his father Steve, drumming on multiple Steve Howe solo albums. Steve, Dylan and his brother [[Virgil Howe]] were in Steve Howe's Remedy band in a 2004 European tour. The [[Steve Howe Trio]] was formed in 2007 with Steve, Dylan and Ross Stanley on Hammond organ. They toured the UK in May 2007 and June 2008 to promote their debut album 'The Haunted Melody' (HoweSound 2008).  Dylan Howe is endorsed by Zildjian cymbals and Hardcase and Protection Racket cases   Dylan's cites his influences as drummers Roy Haynes, Elvin Jones, Philly-Jo Jones, Tony Williams, Al Jackson Jr, Stewart Copeland, John Bonham, Phil Collins, Steve Gadd, Hal Blaine and Bernard &quot;Pretty&quot; Purdie and the music of Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Wayne Shorter, Stax, Motown, David Bowie, Stevie Wonder, Yes, Frank Zappa, Ornette Coleman, Claude Debussy, Steve Reich and Igor Stravinsky.   Dylan Howe married Zoe Street in November 2006. They live in London.  ==Dylan Howe Quintet== [[Image:The Way I Hear It cover.jpg|thumb|left|The Way I Hear It]][[Image:This Is It Cover.jpg|thumb|This Is It (2004) OT Records]] [[Image:DHQTranslation.jpg|thumb|left|Translation - Recorded Live In Soho - Volume 1 (2006)]][[Image:DHQTranslation2cover.jpg|thumb|Translation 2 - Standards and Previews (2007)]]  Dylan Howe formed his jazz quintet in 2003 and has released four solo albums:[http://www.myspace.com/dylanhowe]  *''The Way I Hear It'' (2003) OT Records *''This Is It'' (2004) OT Records *''Translation - Recorded Live In Soho - Volume 1'' (2006) Motorik Recordings *''Translation - Voume 2 - Standards'' (2007) Motorik Recordings  The Quintet has had a changing membership. The main line-up has consisted of Howe, [[Quentin Collins (musician)|Quentin Collins]] (trumpet), Brandon Allen (tenor sax), Ross Stanley (piano) and Chris Hill (double bass).  'Translation - Volume 1' was released [[August 28]] [[2006]] on Motorik Recordings distributed by New Note. 'Translation - Volume 2' followed in 2007 with an accompanying UK tour.   Robert Wyatt sang 'Round Midnight' with the group at their Lincoln Drill Hall gig (22/09/07) on this tour. This was the first time Robert had sung live in nearly 20 years. They plan to collaborate on Dylan's 'Subterraneans' project.   Dylan disbanded his quintet in November 2007 to work on new lineups as leader.   In May 2008 Dylan launched a new group 'Dylan Howe's Unity 4' and toured throughout the UK, with 15 dates in May and June.  The group played music mainly from Hammond organist Larry Young's Blue Note album 'Unity' (as well tunes as Larry Young's 'Into Something' album) and music by Ornette Coleman.  The group comprised of DH - Drums, Tony Kofi - Alto Saxophone, Mike Outram - Guitar and Ross Stanley - Hammond Organ.

Howe has that gift not only of swing, but to play oh, so quietly, making you listen to his very restraint, as he encourages his family of drums to talk together. Just file under a bloody good night out.” Andy Robson - JAZZWISE MAGAZINE October ‘06 &lt;br /&gt; “The remarkable cohesion of the whole band.. Howe's needle-sharp drum fills... and that indefinable sense of occasion which comes when a band knows it is working at the top of its form” Dave Gelly - THE OBSERVER - September 2006 &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Just the right mercurial touch...you might well assume that it came from one of the more advanced Blue Note sessions of the mid 1960's.” Dave Gelly - Jazz Cd of the week -THE OBSERVER August 2005 &lt;br /&gt; &quot;The Drummer-led quintet play with a dexterity and maturity to match any mainstream/hard-bop artists of the 50's and 60's. This is 'it' if you like serious jazz.&quot; MUSICIAN MAGAZINE &lt;br /&gt; “His fills and cymbal rides evoke memories of the great Elvin Jones and Philly-Jo Jones.” JAZZ JOURNAL &lt;br /&gt; “Searing modal, scorching originals - superb retro-hard bop” Critic’s Choice - TIME OUT * &lt;br /&gt; “Intelligent hard bop with a melodic twist.”  Clive Davis: Critic’s choice - THE TIMES &lt;br /&gt; “A looseness reminiscent of Miles's 1960s ensemble... He (DH) knows exactly how the dynamics and drama of this idiom are supposed to work, and he proves himself to be a sophisticated composer of slow tone-poetry.” John Fordham - THE GUARDIAN &lt;br /&gt; “Howe handles the Blue Note genre with ease! Stimulating.” Jack Massarik - Jazz Cd of the Week: LONDON EVENING STANDARD &lt;br /&gt; “A sharp young band breathing new life and inspiration into the hard bop idiom” THE OBSERVER Critics Choice 13/08/06  ==Dylan Howe &amp; The Subterreanans== [[Image:SubterraneansFlyerSunday25thSmall.jpg|thumb|left|Subterraneans flyer]]Howe's new project is Dylan Howe &amp; The Subterreanans, playing the music of [[David Bowie]]'s ''[[Low (album)|Low]]'' and ''[[&quot;Heroes&quot;|Heroes]]'', re-imagined by a 'future jazz sextet' with strings &amp; electronics. They launched in late 2007 with a live show and a preview release of one piece on ''Translation - Volume 2''.[[Image:SubsLineup1.jpg|thumb|Subterraneans rehearsal November 13th 2007]]  The line-up at the launch consisted of Dylan Howe (drums/arrangements), Hugh Cornwell (vox), Tim Dickinson (vox) Ross Stanley (piano/arrangements), Chris Hill ([[double bass]]), Robbie Robson (trumpet), Sam Crockatt (tenor sax) and [[Gilad Atzmon]] (alto sax), with Adrian Utley (guitar, electronics) and The Solid Strings. The project premiered at London's Cargo on 25th November 2007.[[Image:Cargo1.jpg|thumb|Subterraneans launch Cargo - November 25th 2007]]   &quot; Dylan Howe's self-styled &quot;reimagining&quot; of Bowie's instrumental meisterwerks invests them with new life while remaining true to their original spirit. His mini-orchestra (ensemble?) treat the originals as blueprints for some inventive flights of fancy but remain recognisably anchored in Bowie's Berlin. The Thin White Duke would surely approve.&quot; - Tim Cooper, Music Editor, Contemporary Magazine  &quot;A formidable lineup…immaculate, entrancing collective performance. Howe’s trademark powerful yet delicate drumming was the motor propelling this finely-tuned engine. Every piece told its own story. This will not be easily forgotten…&quot; Frederick Bernas  JAZZWISE MAGAZINE  They plan to tour the project in October 2008.  ==Session work==  Dylan Howe has played on over 60 albums and has been hired for session work since he was in his teens, working with producers [[Trevor Horn]], [[John Leckie]], [[Laurie Latham]], [[Steve Lyons]], Geoff Barrow, Kipper (Sting), [[Andy Wright]], [[Richard Stannard (songwriter)|Richard Stannard]] &amp; [[Julian Gallagher]], [[Paul O'Duffy]], [[Nigel Godrich]], [[John Cornwell]], [[Karl Wallinger]], [[John Brough]], [[Steve Power]] and [[Guy Chambers]].

Quotes:  'A superb player' THE OBSERVER   'Swings like an old veteran' MODERN DRUMMER   'Dylan Howe, rightly acclaimed as one of the best drummers of his generation.' RONNIE SCOTTS  'Dylan Howe makes it new. The way he plays it, it's as if Be-bop were still hot and wet from its Harlem womb. Dylan Howe, he plays time from the heart.'

Oil is a [[nonpolar]] substance.  The term oil is often used colloquially to refer to [[petroleum]].  == Etymology == ''Oil'' is a colloquial term used to refer to certain diverse and unrelated compounds sharing the same physical properties (such as viscosity and a hydrophobic nature), while ignoring related compounds. The compounds found in [[cooking oil]] are chemically very similar, almost identical, to those found in butter and very different from those found in diesel fuel, but while diesel is an oil, butter is not. Indeed diesel is once again very similar to natural gas, but gas is certainly not oil. This disparity stems partly from the fact that oils must be liquid at room temperature, and thus only certain liquid chemicals in many unrelated families are recognised, collectively, as 'oil'. Scientists, instead of using the term 'oil', adopt the terms [[lipids]] and other terms to denote them instead.  == Types of oils == === Mineral oil === All oils, with their high carbon and hydrogen content, can be traced back to organic sources.  Mineral oils, found in porous rocks underground, are no exception, as they were originally the organic material, such as dead [[plankton]], accumulated on the seafloor in geologically ancient times. Through various [[geochemical]] processes this material was converted to mineral oil, or [[petroleum]], and its components, such as [[kerosene]], [[paraffin|paraffin waxes]], [[gasoline]], [[diesel]] and such. These are classified as mineral oils as they do not have an organic origin on human timescales, and are instead derived from underground geologic locations, ranging from rocks, to underground traps, to sands.  Other oily substances can also be found in the environment, the most well-known being [[asphalt]], occurring naturally underground or, where there are leaks, in [[tar pits]].  [[Petroleum]] and other mineral oils, (specifically labelled as [[petrochemicals]]), have become such a crucial resource to human civilization in modern times they are often referred to by the ubiquitous term of 'oil' itself.  === Organic oil === Oils are also produced by plants, animals and other organisms through [[organic chemistry|organic]] processes, and these oils  are remarkable in their diversity. Oil is a somewhat vague term to use [[Chemistry|chemically]], and the scientific term for oils, [[fat]]s, [[wax]]es, [[cholesterol]] and other oily substances found in living things and their secretions, is [[lipid]]s.  Lipids, ranging from waxes to [[steroids]], are somewhat hard to characterize, and are united in a group almost solely based on the fact that they all repel, or refuse to dissolve, in [[water]], and are however comfortably [[miscible]] in other liquid lipids. They also have a high [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]] content, and are considerably lacking in [[oxygen]] compared to other organic compounds and minerals.  == Applications == === Food oils === Many edible vegetable and [[animal]] oils, and also [[fat]]s, are used for various in [[Cooking oil|cooking]] and [[food]] preparation. In particular, many foods are [[frying|fried]] in oil much hotter than boiling [[water]]. Oils are also used for flavoring and for modifying the texture of foods e.g. [[Stir frying|Stir Fry]].  [[Health]] advantages are claimed for a number of specific oils such as [[omega 3]] oils ([[fish oil]], [[flaxseed oil]], etc) and [[evening primrose oil]].  [[Trans fats]], often produced by [[hydrogenation|hydrogenating]] vegetable oils, are known to be harmful to health.  === Fuel === Almost all oils [[Combustion|burn]] in [[air]] generating [[heat]], which can be used directly, or converted into other forms of fuels by various means.  For example, heating water into [[steam]] which is funneled into a [[turbine]] which turns a [[Electrical generator|generator]], which then produces [[electricity]]. Oils are used as [[fuel]]s for [[heating]], lighting (e.g. [[kerosene lamp]]),  powering [[combustion]] engines, and other purposes. Oils used for this purpose nowadays are usually derived from [[petroleum]], ([[fuel oil]], [[diesel oil]], [[gasoline]] (petrol), etc), though biological oils such as [[biodiesel]] are gaining market share.  === Heat transport === Many oils have higher [[boiling point]]s than water and are [[electrical insulators]], making them useful for [[liquid cooling]] systems, especially where electricity is used.   === Lubrication === Due to their non-polarity, oils do not easily adhere to other substances. This makes oils useful as [[lubricant]]s for various engineering purposes. Mineral oils are more suitable than biological oils, which degrade rapidly in most environmental conditions.  === Painting === Color pigments can be easily [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in oil, making it suitable as supporting medium for [[Oil paint|paints]]. The slow drying process and miscibility of oil facilitates a realistic style. This method has been used since the 15th century.  === Petrochemicals === {{main|Petrochemicals}} [[Crude oil]] can be processed into [[petroleum]], plastics, and other substances.  ==Other Usages == [[Sulfuric acid]] has been called [[oil of vitriol]] in pre-scientific times, due to its syrupy consistency.  Even in modern times, sulfuric acid is sometimes called vitriolic acid, and caustic personalities are called &quot;vitriolic.&quot;  Sulfuric acid is not a petrochemical, and in modern parlance, is not an oil.  === Religion === Oils have been used throughout history as a fragrant or [[Religion|religious]] medium. Oil is often seen as a spiritually purifying agent. It is used in religious ceremonies, such as the [[chrism]] used in [[baptism]], and has traditionally been used to [[Anointing|anoint]] kings and queens.  Oil that is associated with one or more saints is known as &quot;[[oil of saints]]&quot; and believed by some to have beneficial properties, as is &quot;oil of [[Christian martyrs|martyrs]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11228d.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Oil of Saints&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;.  ==References== {{Reflist}}  == See also == *[[Emulsifier]], allow oils and water to mix *[[Oil pollution]] *[[List of countries by oil production]] *[[List of countries by oil consumption]] *[[List of countries by oil proven reserves]] *[[List of countries by oil exports]] *[[List of countries by oil imports]]  *[[Wax]], compounds with oil-like properties that are solid at common temperature  [[Category:Oils]] [[Category:Massage]]  {{Link FA|ms}}  [[ar:زيت]] [[an:Azeite]] [[az:Yağ]] [[ca:Oli]] [[cs:Olej]] [[cy:Olew]] [[da:Olie]] [[de:Öle]] [[el:Λάδι]] [[es:Aceite]] [[eo:Oleo]] [[eu:Olio]] [[fa:روغن]] [[fr:Huile]] [[gd:Ola]] [[gl:Aceite]] [[ko:기름]] [[hr:Ulja]] [[io:Oleo]] [[id:Minyak]] [[is:Olía]] [[it:Óleo]] [[he:שמן]] [[kg:Mafuta]] [[lad:Azete]] [[ln:Mafúta]] [[ms:Minyak]] [[nl:Olie]] [[ja:油]] [[no:Olje]] [[nn:Olje]] [[pl:Oleje]] [[pt:Óleo]] [[ru:Масло]] [[simple:Oil]] [[sk:Olej]] [[sl:Olje]] [[su:Minyak]] [[fi:Öljy]] [[sv:Olja]] [[th:น้ำมัน]] [[uk:Олія]] [[vec:Ojo]] [[yi:בוימל]] [[zh:油]]</text>     </revision>

After Farndon's dismissal from the band and Honeyman-Scott's death, [[Chrissie Hynde]] (vocals, guitar) and [[Martin Chambers]] (drums) initially recruited [[Rockpile]]'s [[Billy Bremner (musician)|Billy Bremner]] and [[Big Country]]'s [[Tony Butler (musician)|Tony Butler]] to fill out a caretaker line-up of The Pretenders in 1982. Bremner played guitar and Butler played bass on the band's September 1982 single &quot;Back on the Chain Gang&quot;/&quot;My City Was Gone&quot;, both sides of which were later included on ''Learning to Crawl''.  As the album sessions got under way, Bremner, The Rumour's Andrew Bodnar, and [[Paul Carrack]] (formerly of [[Squeeze]], [[Ace (band)|Ace]] and [[Roxy Music]]) played guitar, bass and piano respectively for the track &quot;Thin Line Between Love and Hate.&quot;  Finally, Robbie McIntosh (guitar) and Malcolm Foster (bass) were recruited to join Hynde and Chambers, and the band was now officially a quartet. It was this line-up that recorded the majority of the tracks featured on ''Learning to Crawl''.  The November 1983 single &quot;[[2000 Miles]]&quot;/&quot;Fast or Slow (The Law's the Law)&quot; was the newly reconstituted foursome's first release, followed shortly by the full ''Learning to Crawl'' album in January 1984.  ==Track listing== All songs written by [[Chrissie Hynde]], except as indicated. # &quot;[[Middle of the Road (song)|Middle of the Road]]&quot; – 4:08 # &quot;[[Back on the Chain Gang]]&quot; – 3:44 # &quot;Time the Avenger&quot; – 4:47 # &quot;Watching the Clothes&quot; – 2:46 # &quot;Show Me&quot; – 4:00 # &quot;Thumbelina&quot; – 3:12 # &quot;[[My City Was Gone]]&quot; – 5:14 # &quot;Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot; ([[Richard Poindexter]], [[Robert Poindexter]], [[Jackie Members]]) – 3:33 # &quot;I Hurt You&quot; – 4:27 # &quot;[[2000 Miles]]&quot; – 3:30  ===Bonus tracks (Re-release)=== #&lt;li value=11&gt;&quot;Fast or Slow (The Law's the Law)&quot; ([[Martin Chambers]]) – 3:15 # &quot;Tequila&quot; – 3:35 # &quot;I Hurt You&quot; ([[Denmark Street]] Demo, August 1982) – 4:06 # &quot;When I Change My Life&quot; (Denmark Street Demo, August 1982) – 4:43 # &quot;Ramblin' Rob&quot; (Denmark Street Demo, August 1982) ([[Robbie McIntosh]]) – 3:32 # &quot;My City Was Gone&quot; (Live) – 4:53 # &quot;[[Money (That's What I Want)]]&quot; (Live at [[US Festival]], May 1983) ([[Berry Gordy Jr.]], [[Janie Bradford]]) – 4:39  ==Personnel== *[[Chrissie Hynde]] – [[rhythm guitar]], [[lead vocals]] *[[Martin Chambers]] – [[Drum kit|drums]], vocals *[[Robbie McIntosh]] – lead guitar, backing vocals *[[Malcolm Foster]] – [[bass guitar]], backing vocals ===Additional personnel=== *[[Billy Bremner (musician)|Billy Bremner]] – lead guitar on &quot;Back on the Chain Gang&quot; and &quot;My City Was Gone&quot;, rhythm guitar and vocals on &quot;Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot; *[[Tony Butler (bass player)|Tony Butler]] – bass guitar on &quot;Back on the Chain Gang&quot; and &quot;My City Was Gone&quot; *[[Andrew Bodnar]] – bass guitar and vocals on &quot;Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot; *[[Paul Carrack]] – piano and vocals on &quot;Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot;  ==Charts== '''Album''' {| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; !align=&quot;left&quot;|Year !align=&quot;left&quot;|Chart !align=&quot;left&quot;|Position |- |align=&quot;left&quot;|1984 |align=&quot;left&quot;|The [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] 200 |align=&quot;left&quot;|5 |- |} '''Singles''' {| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; !align=&quot;left&quot;|Year !align=&quot;left&quot;|Single !align=&quot;left&quot;|Chart !align=&quot;left&quot;|Position |- |align=&quot;left&quot;|1983 |align=&quot;left&quot;|&quot;Back on the Chain Gang&quot; |align=&quot;left&quot;|Billboard Mainstream Rock |align=&quot;left&quot;|4 |- |align=&quot;left&quot;|1983 |align=&quot;left&quot;|&quot;Back on the Chain Gang&quot; |align=&quot;left&quot;|Billboard Pop Singles |align=&quot;left&quot;|5 |- |align=&quot;left&quot;|1983 |align=&quot;left&quot;|&quot;Middle of the Road&quot; |align=&quot;left&quot;|The Billboard Hot 100 |align=&quot;left&quot;|19 |- |align=&quot;left&quot;|1983 |align=&quot;left&quot;|&quot;My City Was Gone&quot; |align=&quot;left&quot;|Billboard Mainstream Rock |align=&quot;left&quot;|11 |- |align=&quot;left&quot;|1983 |align=&quot;left&quot;|&quot;Middle of the Road&quot; |align=&quot;left&quot;|Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play |align=&quot;left&quot;|43 |- |align=&quot;left&quot;|1984 |align=&quot;left&quot;|&quot;Show Me&quot; |align=&quot;left&quot;|The Billboard Hot 100 |align=&quot;left&quot;|28 |- |align=&quot;left&quot;|1984 |align=&quot;left&quot;|&quot;Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot; |align=&quot;left&quot;|The Billboard Hot 100 |align=&quot;left&quot;|83 |- |}  ==Certifications== {| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; &quot; !align=&quot;left&quot;|Organization !align=&quot;left&quot;|Level !align=&quot;left&quot;|Date |- |align=&quot;left&quot;|RIAA – USA |align=&quot;left&quot;|Gold |align=&quot;left&quot;|[[April 18]] [[1984]] |- |align=&quot;left&quot;|RIAA – USA |align=&quot;left&quot;|Platinum |align=&quot;left&quot;|[[April 18]] [[1984]] |- |}  {{The Pretenders}}  [[Category:The Pretenders albums]] [[Category:1984 albums]] [[Category:Albums produced by Chris Thomas]]</text>     </revision>

He is among the team’s career leaders in [[kickoff]]s (64 returns for 1,711 yards), with the second-best average of 26.7. His 93-yard return against [[Washington Redskins|Washington]] on Nov. 17, 1963, is tied for seventh-longest in team history. He played for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] from 1967 to 1972, then split his final pro year between the [[New York Giants]] and the [[Minnesota Vikings]].

There is an entrance to [[Chopwell Wood]], whose forest festival and [[Christmas Trees]] attract many visitors to the village every year.  High Spen has one pub, called The Bute Arms, and two [[Working men's club|Working Men's clubs]]. There is also a [[Primary school]], called High Spen County Primary, and a [[Comprehensive school]], called Hookergate. High Spen also is home to St Patrick's [[Church of England|C of E]] [[Church]].  High Spen used to have a bus depot (located off Strothers Road) that was home to the Venture Bus Company. Venture used to run services around Derwent Valley, mainly between Shotley Bridge and Newcastle. Venture, and the bus depot at High Spen, eventually passed into the hands of Northern General Transport, where it stayed operational until the late 80's when it was eventually closed down.  During the first world war, two soldiers from High Spen were awarded the Victoria Cross: Lance Corporal William Dobson of the Coldstream Guards, and Private Thomas Young of the Durham Light Infantry.  High Spen was categorised as a &quot;category D village&quot; by Durham County Council, one of many scheduled for destruction and demolition following the decline of mining in the west of the county in the 1950's and '60's.  The D-village policy was cancelled in 1977, since when the village has gradually grown and developed, serving as a commuter village accessible to the centres of Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead and Durham City.  == External links == *[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/DUR/HighSpen/index.html HIGH SPEN A HUNDRED YEARS] * [http://www.highspen.org.uk High Spen Traditional Rapper Sword Dancers]  {{coord missing|United Kingdom}}  [[Category:villages in Tyne and Wear]]  {{TyneandWear-geo-stub}}</text>     </revision>

The body is strongly boned, with a powerful neck and large head. The medium-length flat coat is very thick and densely undercoated, providing suitable protection from the harsh climate of the area, as well as from [[predators]]. The most common and valued [[coat (dog)|colouring]] is black and tan, but some tricoloured and [[piebald]] examples can be found, too. A variety of sizes can be encountered, from specimens that are 24 [[inches]] tall to those exceeding 30 [[inches]] at the [[withers]].   ==History== Belonging to a leaner variety of Asian [[Molosser|Molossers]], the Kashmiri Sheepdog is related to some types of the [[Tibetan Mastiff]] and dogs of [[Central Asia]], but is claimed by the Gujjar herdsmen to be much older than any other breed of the region. While this is debatable, the black-and-tan colouring and physical build of the Bakarwal Mastiff have led some authorities to link a number of old Molosser to this dog, namely the [[Hyrcanian Dog|Hyrcanian Mastiff]], the [[Molossos tis Epirou]], the [[Sylvan dog|Sylvan]], the [[Tuvan Sheepdog]], and the [[Siah Sag]] variety of the [[Iranian]] [[Sage Mazandarani]], as well as the European descendants of these breeds.   ==External links== * [http://www.molosserdogs.com/modules.php?name=Encyclopedia&amp;op=content&amp;tid=3235 MolosserDogs.com Bakharwal Dog] * [http://www.doggyhelp.com/dogs/breeds/Bakharwal%20Dog Bakharwal Dog (with photos)]  [[Category:Dog breeds]] [[Category:Dog breeds originating in the Indian subcontinent]] [[Category:Dog breeds originating in Asia]] [[Category:Molossers]]  [[de:Bakharwal]]</text>     </revision>

Recently, a district reform made Paretz into a borough of the city of [[Ketzin]].  It has a population of approximately 400. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries the village was the summer residence King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and of his wife [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Louise]].  [[Image:Paretz Ortseingang.jpg|thumb|Gate houses at the entrance to Paretz]]  == Paretz Palace ==  The manorial estate of Paretz was originally property of the von Bredow family from whom, in 1677, the Brandenburg diplomat [[Christoph Caspar von Blumenthal]] bought it. It was from here that his daughter Wilhelmina eloped with Ernst Christian von Weiler, a married man, in 1689. The estate was inherited by Count [[Heinrich von Blumenthal]], former commander of the [[Garde du Corps (Prussia)|Garde du Corps]], who in retirement was tutor to the Crown Prince Frederick William (later King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]]).   The Crown Prince had a sad childhood, but he was always happy staying with his tutor at Paretz. For this reason, in 1795 he bought the estate of ''Paretz'' from his tutor's son, his former playmate Count Heinrich von Blumenthal, for 80,000 [[Thaler]]s (approximately € 120,000 as of 2005).  The Berlin architect [[David Gilly]] was put in charge of the construction of the building and it was planned to become a country palace.  &quot;Just remember always that you are building for a poor farmer&quot;, the crown prince is said to have told the architect.  Flanking the palace were placed two barn buildings each, on the left and right, (one on each side to house animals) thus forming a semi circular yard.  In 1804 the royal couple had the entire village rebuilt to conform to David Gilly's designs but the uniform style is hardly recognizable anymore today.  After the death of Queen Louise in 1810 the palace was left unchanged until 1840 when [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]] had the wallpaper and furniture replaced in several rooms.  The appeal of the ''Schloss-Still-im-Land'' was lost however and the palace remained untouched and empty until early in the 20th century.  The palace continued to be owned by the [[Hohenzollern]] until 1945:  King Frederick William IV had passed the palace on to King [[Wilhelm I of Germany| Wilhelm I]] who became Emperor of Germany in 1871.  In 1888 Prince [[Albert Wilhelm Heinrich of Prussia|Heinrich]] took over the palace and his wife [[Princess Irene of Hesse and the Rhine]] continued after his death in 1929.  In April 1945 the [[Red Army]] took possession of the grounds and the troops didn't leave until halfway through 1946.  A year later, [[refugee]]s moved into the buildings and in 1948 ownership of the palace was transferred to the ''Zentrale Verwaltung der gegenseitigen Bauernhilfe (ZVdgB)'' (&quot;Central Administration of Mutual Aid to Farmers&quot;).  Modifications to the complex through 1950 completely changed the look of the palace and farm.  Special attractions of the palace are the tapestries that are adorned with exotic plant motives, bird renditions and depictions of landscapes in the [[Potsdam]] area.  The tapestries survived [[World War II]] as they had been removed and kept in the [[New Palace]] in Potsdam for safe keeping.  {| | [[Image:Chateau Paretz.JPG|thumb|left|Paretz Palace]] | [[Image:Chateau Paretz Facade.jpg|thumb|Facade of the palace]] |}  == Gothic house == [[Image:Paretz Gotisches Haus.jpg|thumb|200px|Gothic house]] The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] house is a former royal [[forge]].  It is notable as the only neo-Gothic structure among the other rather simple buildings.  Currently, a restaurant is being operated in the Gothic house.  == Paretzer Erdlöcher == During the 19th century the production of tiles was an important industry for the area as they could be sold to the ever growing city of Berlin.  Therefore, many villages had several tile producing companies.  But to make the tiles clay was needed and mined from the clay ground common to the area.  When the business slowed down, the clay mines filled with [[ground water]] and turned into small lakes, the ''Erdlöcher'' or &quot;holes in the ground&quot;.  Today they are home to numerous water fowl and have been placed under environmental protection.  &lt;gallery&gt; Image:Paretz ERDLOECHER08.jpg Image:Paretz ERDLOECHER15.jpg Image:Paretz Erdlöcher.jpg Image:Paretz ERDLOECHER11.jpg &lt;/gallery&gt;  == Theodor Fontane == [[Image:Fontane in Paretz.jpg|right|200px]] The German poet and author [[Theodor Fontane]] liked the village a lot and come to visit Paretz three times:  in the spring of 1861, 1869 and in May of 1870.  He describes the farm Paretz in his '' Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg'' in vivid colors:  :&quot;Uetz and Paretz are separated by little more than half a mile.  On a summer afternoon this is an inspiring walk.  The path leads through the meadows and the smell of hay is present from the fields all around us.  A thin, fog lit by the sun marks the spot where the wide Havel with its many bays and lakes lies.  Paretz itself does not appear to us until the very last.&quot;  :&quot;Finally the path turns into a levee and instead of the fruit trees that so far have kept us company there are tall [[poplar]]s and royal buildings everywhere until we cross a light and elegant bridge, called the ''Infantenbrücke'', and reach the village road.  The road takes us through the park then grows wider just after going around a bend and we are there.&quot;  ==References== ''This article is based on a translation of an article from the [[:de:Hauptseite|German Wikipedia]]''.  == External links ==  *''[http://www.paretz-verein.de/ Verein Historisches Paretz]'' *''[http://www.louise-kult-tour.de/ LOUISE-KULT-ToUR]'' *[http://www.gotisches-haus-paretz.de/ Gothic House Restaurant].  {{coord|52|28|N|12|53|E|display=title}}  [[Category:Villages in Brandenburg]] [[Category:Buildings and structures in Brandenburg]] [[Category:Palaces in Germany]]  [[de:Paretz]] [[pt:Schloss Paretz]]</text>     </revision>

Held since May 28, 1989 on [[Memorial Day]] weekend, the race attracts people from the [[New England]] area.  The race is produced by RunVermont, a not-for-profit organization committed to promoting running in Vermont.  RunVermont also organizes several other races as well as the Lake Champlain Women's Running Camp, adult training programs, and a youth running and health education program called Many Milers. == The Race == The race is held annually on the Sunday of [[Memorial Day]] weekend.  Runners in the Vermont City Marathon can compete in the full marathon, on a two-person relay team running [[half marathon| half marathons]], or on a three-to-five person relay team.  In 2007, there were 2504 marathon finishers, 441 two-person teams and 664 three-to-five person teams.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} Due to overwhelming demand in the relay events, relay team spots are available only through a lottery while spots for the full marathon can be acquired through the standard entry process.  == The Course == The [[USATF]] certified course has remained the same since 2001.  It starts in Battery Park overlooking [[Lake Champlain]], does a 3.1 mile loop through downtown Burlington, then heads out the Burlington Beltway, a highway that is closed to traffic only once a year for the marathon.  The course then climbs back into downtown Burlington before heading South and joining the Burlington Bikepath at Oakledge Park, where the halfway point is reached.  The course follows the bikepath north to the &quot;Assault on Battery Hill&quot;, the largest climb on the course.  After going through Battery Park, the course does a final loop through residential neighborhoods in the north side of Burlington, then follows the bikepath back to the finish at Waterfront Park beside Lake Champlain. The course record for men, set by Michael Khobotov in 2001, is 2:17:03.  The course record for Women, set in 1995 by Gordon Bakoulis, is 2:38:32. ==History== [[Image:2008 Vermont City Marathon Metal.JPG|thumb|300px|2008 Vermont City Marathon Medal]]There is an ongoing disagreement between the race's Board of Directors and one of the runners.  In 1998 a club called the &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; was formed to honor runners who had been a part of the event each of the first ten VCMs.  Membership is a mix of those who have completed every marathon, some who have started but not finished all years, some who have run on a relay team in various years, and still others who for various reasons registered for all of the VCM races but did not start some of the races.  The disagreeing runner wears a cone shaped hat proclaiming &quot;Hall of Farce&quot; as he runs the race reflecting his belief that the club should honor only those who have achieved it by finishing every race.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.7dvt.com/2005/new-top-prosecutor# Seven Days]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://boysweekend.com/v-web/bulletin/bb/viewtopic.php?t=475&amp;sid=c6eb5f4f0df6eadef351df650b2796e7 Bulletin Board]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sam Hemingway,''Burlington Free Press'', May 26, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  == Footnotes == {{reflist}}  == External links == *[http://www.runvermont.org/marathon/index.html Vermont City Marathon] *[http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=117275739630837992683.00000112af2a412bffcd8&amp;ll=44.487199,-73.215294&amp;spn=0.085725,0.160675&amp;z=13&amp;om=0&amp;iwloc=00000112af39cbe78bfa8 Unoffical Google Map of Course] Can be importing into Google Earth for examining elevation etc.  [[Category:Recurring events established in 1988]] [[Category:Marathons in the United States]] [[Category:Sports in Vermont]] [[Category:Burlington, Vermont]]</text>     </revision>

The tension brewed until massive race riots and [[revolt]]s appeared all over Panama, creating turmoil in an already battered nation.  During this time, many Panamanian citizens despised the American citizens because they felt as if the US had dominated the labor force.  Panamanians that once held jobs were left unemployed, because once the U.S. completed the trans-Panama railroad, they terminated the entire labor force.  The U.S. then filled the administrative and supervisory roles with Americans, while only a few jobs were left for the Panamanians on the [[railroad]] lines.  During this railroad boom, many U.S. citizens were seen passing through Panama City, and with the animosity brewing, a riot was inevitable.  ==The Riot== On that particular April morning the U.S. [[Steamboat|steamer]], John L. Stephens, transported about 1,000 passengers to Panama City.  However, the station was located at the waterfront and Panama City did not then have any [[wharf]]s where ships could dock.  Therefore, ships like John L. Stephens had to dock on a surrounding island, in this case [[Taboga Island]], and then be ferried to Panama City.  The passengers could only be ferried during high tide and, on this particular day, the John L. Stephens arrived during low tide; therefore, the passengers had to sit and wait on [[high tide]].    Most of the passengers were drunk by this time because many of them had visited the local cantinas before the trip.  One very drunk and arrogant American, Jack Oliver, decided to walk around the station and encountered a vendor selling [[watermelon]].  Oliver grabbed a slice of the watermelon, which was priced at five cents per slice, and refused to pay for it.  The vendor yelled at Oliver and eventually pulled out a [[knife]] and threatened him.  One of Oliver’s friends then tossed five cents at the vendor, but the vendor continued yelling at Oliver until Oliver pulled out a [[gun]].  At this point the vendor took off running, but another Panamanian, who saw the entire incident, grabbed Oliver’s arm and the two struggled for the gun. During this struggle, the gun went off and a bystander was wounded.  At this point, the riot was unavoidable as more Panimanians arrived and more shots began to be fired.  Many Americans were beaten unmercifully, robbed, and many buildings were destroyed.  When the police arrived later, one of them was hit by a [[bullet]], which forced them to join in the riot.  Everyone in the area, even the [[police]] and authority figures, were involved in the Watermelon War.  Finally, a [[train]] arrived filled with armed railroad men, who were led by [[Randolph Runnels]].  The railroad men then fired at the [[crowd|mob]] and most of them ran for cover.  Runnels then shouted to the mob to put down the weapons and come out with their hands over their heads.  In the end, Governor Aniño, submitted an official report that stated 15 Americans were dead and 16 wounded, and 2 Panamanians were dead and 13 wounded  ==Consequences==  On July 18, the American commissioner, [[Amos Corwine]], recommended in his report &quot; ... the immediate occupation of the isthmus.&quot; This raised a series of diplomatic controversies.  Accordingly, the North American authorities attended to the report and on September, 1856 American troops unlawfully invaded Panama disembarking in the isthmus and taking the railway station.  On September 19 of that year, a detachment of 160 soldiers took possession of the railway station. The city was calm and three days later, the troops moved back without having fired a single shot. This brief occupation was supposedly justified according to the U.S. government by a clause in the Agreement of 1846, by means of which, the United States was guaranteeing the neutrality of the isthmus, so that transit was not interrupted.  ===Proposal===  Taking advantage for their own benefit the United States made the following proposals:  1. That the city of [[Panama City|Panama]] and [[Colón, Panama|Colón]] had to be free cities and that they were governed under the sovereignty of Panama, and jointly they will control a strip land twenty miles wide from ocean to ocean, with the railroad as the central line.  2. Panama had to transfer several islands in the [[Bay of Panama]] to the United States to use them as naval bases.  3. Panama had to transfer its rights on the Panamanian Railroad to the United States   4. Panama had to pay compensation for damages for the loss of life and the destruction of property.  ===Compensation===  Finally the government of Panama accepted the terms and signed the [[Herrán-Cass]] Agreement.  On September 10, 1857 the Panamanian government established a sum compensation of $412.394 in gold for damages.  * 195.410 dollars for indemnifications derived from the riot. * 65.070 dollars for new claims. * 9.277 dollars for expenses of the commissioners * 142.637 dollars for interests.  The United States was not alone in demanding indemnifications, France and England, whose citizens turned out to be affected as well, also demanded compensation.  In turn, the United States used this incident as an excuse to put Article 35 of the Mallarino-Bidlack Agreement into practice.  That is to say, its prerogative of safeguarding the neutrality and free transit in Panama, and use of armed forces when the local government is deemed unfit.  This motivated a series of American interventions in the isthmus during the 19th and 20th century, which at last irritated the xenophobia and the nationalistic feeling of the Panamanians.  According to the Gazette of the State of May 3, 1856, the dead persons were Lucas Prados and Apolinar N. of Panama; and Robert Marks, of Pennsylvania; Octavio Dubois, French; N. Stokes, of the filibusters of [[William Walker (soldier)]]; Alexander Sweet, of Maine and another 12 of whom the names are not known.

Its transmitter is located northwest of the city and [[Interstate 476|I-476]] in [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]]. Owned by Mystic Television of Scranton, LLC, the station is operated by New Age Media, LLC though a [[Local marketing agreement|local marketing agreement]] (LMA). This makes WSWB a sister station to [[Fox Network|Fox]] affiliate [[WOLF-TV]] and [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[WQMY]]. The three stations share studios on S.R. 315 in the Fox Hill section of [[Plains Township, Pennsylvania|Plains Township]]. Although WSWB operates its own digital signal, the station is also offered on WOLF-TV's second digital subchannel. This is because WSWB cannot be received in many parts of the Wilkes-Barre area. [[television syndication|Syndicated]] programming on the station includes: ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Reba (TV series)|Reba]]'', and ''[[The Tyra Banks Show|Tyra]]''.  ==History== Channel 38 first signed on [[June 3]], [[1985]] as '''WOLF-TV''' the first [[independent station]] in northeast Pennsylvania. A few days later, it signed on a full-powered satellite, WWLF-TV, on channel 56 in [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania|Hazleton]]. Channel 56 was intended to improve WOLF's coverage in the southern part of the market as channel 38's transmitter is located farther north than the other major stations in the area. After a little more than a year as an independent, WOLF-TV became a charter affiliate of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network in [[1986]]. The network requested most of its affiliates to air local news in [[1990]]. To satisfy this, the station began airing a nightly 10 o'clock newscast produced by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WNEP-TV]] in [[1991]]. Know as ''Newswatch 16 at 10 on Fox 38'', it was the first instance of one station producing a newscast for another. Two years later, another satellite, WILF-TV in [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]], signed on to improve coverage in the far northern part of the market.  In [[1993]], WOLF's original local owner, Scranton TV Partners, merged with Pegasus Communications.  Pegasus immediately sought permission to move either the channel 38 or channel 56 transmitter to the northeast Pennsylvania tower farm at [[Penobscot Knob]]. Channel 38 provides only a Grade B signal to much of the southern part of the market. Ultimately, Pegasus was allowed to move the WWLF transmitter to Penobscot Knob. On [[November 1]], [[1998]], Pegasus activated the new channel 56 transmitter and moved the WOLF-TV call letters, Fox affiliation and the WNEP-produced newscast there. Meanwhile, channel 38 became a [[The WB|WB]] affiliate under new calls, '''WSWB'''.  The WSWB calls were chosen because they could mean &quot;Scranton's WB&quot; for its affiliation, or the area it serves, Scranton / Wilkes-Barre.  Originally, channel 38 was given the WSWB calls in [[1981]] but they were changed to WOLF-TV before the station went on the air in 1985. WILF in Williamsport remained as a WSWB satellite.  At the time of the switch, WSWB also picked up a secondary affiliation with [[UPN]]. WSWB showed select UPN programs on Saturday nights without the network's branding. At 8 P.M., the station would air ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'' and at 9 P.M. would be ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|WWE SmackDown]]''. Whenever America's Next Top Model was in repeats, WSWB would air ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' instead. All UPN programming was also available on cable in the Scranton area via [[WWOR-TV]] from [[New York City]], [[WPSG]] from [[Philadelphia]], or [[WLYH-TV]] from [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]. On [[January 24]], [[2006]], UPN and The WB announced that they would cease broadcasting and merge. The newly combined network would be called '''The CW'''. The letters would represent the first initial of its corporate parents: [[CBS]] (the parent company of UPN) and the [[Warner Bros.]] unit of [[Time Warner]].   On [[February 22]], [[News Corporation]] announced that they would start up another new broadcast television network called '''MyNetworkTV'''. This new network, which would be sister to Fox, would be operated by [[Fox Television Stations]] and its syndication division, [[Twentieth Television]]. [[MyNetworkTV]] was created in order to give UPN and WB stations, not mentioned as becoming CW affiliates, another option besides becoming independent. It was also created to compete against The CW. On [[May 1]], Pegasus announced that WILF would become a separate station and be the area's MyNetworkTV affiliate under the calls WQMY. Also at that point, WSWB was announced as being affiliated with The CW. MyNetworkTV began broadcasting on [[September 5]]. WSWB began broadcasting The CW on [[September 18]].  == Digital television == {| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; |- ! Virtual&lt;br&gt;Channel ! Physical&lt;br&gt;RF Channel !

I'm not questioning the verifiability of the specific films/plays; they can have their own articles. I maintain that loosely associating them in this fashion is original research. Also, to quote the [[Singapore gay films|film article]]: ''&quot;...there is to date not a single film entirely produced by Singaporeans in Singapore belonging to this genre.&quot;'' Then why make an article about something that doesn't exist? --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Krash|Krash]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Krash|Talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:37, 26 February 2006 (UTC) ::*I hope you understand that Singapore don't have a landscape anywhere close to the [[Brokeback Mountain]].

[[Singapore gay theatre]] and [[Singapore gay films]] seem verifiable. The more recent events mentioned in [[Singapore gay art]] are probably verifiable online. According to the [[Singapore public gay parties]] article, the 2004 Nations party was mentioned in Time Magazine and the 2005 version was mentioned in the Sydney Morning Herald;so, it is sourced and somewhat notable. . Where references are wanting, it looks like they might be added. The films article mentions Bugis Street, a Hong Kong-Singapore co-production about Singaporean transvestites, and Rice Rhapsody about a Singaporean gay divorcée; so the topic of the article exists. I think it is acceptable to make an original compilation of information that is verifiable; that is what most articles are. The ban on original research is directed at unverifiable information. The articles are not indiscriminate collections, though the film article is a bit weak here. Pulling the information together adds informational value. Taken together, the articles give a picture of LGBT culture and life in Singapore, which I find to be an interesting topic.

It is possible for melody or harmony to form a sequence without the other participating.  A sequence can be described according its direction (ascending or descending in pitch) and its adherence to the [[Diatonic and chromatic|diatonic]] scale -- that is, the sequence is diatonic if the pitches remain within the scale, but chromatic (or non-diatonic) if pitches outside of the diatonic scale are used and especially if all pitches are shifted by exactly the same [[Interval (music)|interval]] (i.e., they are [[Transposition (music)|transposed]]).  The non-diatonic sequence tends to [[Modulation (music)|modulate]] to a new [[tonality]] or to cause temporarily tonicization.  At least two instances of a sequential pattern -- including the original statement -- are required to identify a sequence, and the pattern should be based on several melody notes or at least two successive harmonies (chords).  Although stereotypically associated with the music of [[Antonio Vivaldi]], this device is widespread in Western music history.  ==Examples== A well-known popular example of a threefold ''descending'' diatonic sequence is found in the [[refrain]] from the [[Christmas carol]] &quot;[[Angels We Have Heard on High]],&quot; as illustrated immediately below.  The one-[[Bar (music)|measure]] melodic [[Motif (music)|motive]] is shifted downward at the [[Interval (music)|interval]] of a second, and the harmonic aspect does so likewise by following the [[circle of fifths]]:   [[Image:AngelsWe_Gloria.png|center|600px]]  The following three-fold ''ascending'' chromatic (non-diatonic) sequence occurs in the duet of Abubeker and Fatima from Act III of [[César Cui]]'s opera ''[[Prisoner of the Caucasus]]'' (compare a similar passage in the famous [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] [[song]] &quot;[[Do-Re-Mi]],&quot; composed almost exactly 100 years later):   [[Image:Cui Kav 20 1Russ pv0007 1000.png|center|600px]]  {{music-theory-stub}} [[Category:Music theory]]  [[de:Sequenz (Musik)]] [[eo:Sekvenco (muziko)]] [[fr:Marche harmonique]] [[he:סקוונצה]] [[hu:Szekvencia (zene)]] [[it:Progressione armonica]] [[nl:Sequens (muziek)]] [[pl:Sekwencja (pieśń)]] [[fi:Sekvenssi (musiikki)]]</text>     </revision>

Pojmański discovered the comet at [[Warsaw University]] Astronomic Observatory using the [[Las Campanas Observatory]] in [[Chile]] as part of the [[All Sky Automated Survey]] (ASAS). Kazimieras Cernis at the Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astronomy at [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]], located it the same night and before the announcement of Pojmański's discovery,  in ultraviolet images taken a few days earlier by the SWAN instrument aboard the [[SOHO satellite]]. A pre-discovery picture was later found from [[December 29]], [[2005]].  At the time of its discovery, the comet was roughly 113 million miles (181 million kilometers) from the Sun. But orbital elements indicated that on [[February 22]], [[2006]], it would reach [[perihelion]] at a distance of 51.6 million miles — almost half the Earth's average distance from the Sun.   The comet moved on a northward path across the night sky, and reached maximum brightness around the beginning of March. Comet Pojmański reached the very fringe of naked-eye visibility at about [[magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]  5, and was best visible through [[binoculars]] or a [[telescope]]. It could be found in the dawn sky within the constellation [[Capricornus]], close to the horizon in the northern hemisphere, during late February, but viewing circumstances became better for the northern hemisphere as the comet departed southern skies and continued north.  [[Image:pojmanski c2006a1.jpg|thumb|left|Comet Pojmański (C/2006 A1) from [[Mt. Laguna]], [[March 2]] [[2006]].]] By early March, the comet was located in [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], the [[Eagle]], and by [[March 7]] was located in the constellation [[Delphinus]], the [[Dolphin]].  Comet Pojmański brightened more than initially estimated, perhaps due to over-cautious estimates by astronomers. It had previously been estimated to reach a maximum brightness of around 6.5 magnitude, but became considerably brighter.  During the comet's appearance, it sported a tail of three to seven degrees (six to fourteen times the apparent lunar diameter) and a [[coma (cometary)|coma]] of up to about 10 [[arcseconds]].  ==External links== *{{JPL Small Body|name=Pojmanski}} (Accessed [[April 16]] [[2008]]) *[http://www.space.com/spacewatch/060224_night_sky.html Space.com:  &quot;New Comet Brightens Rapidly&quot; (Accessed 2/27/06)] *[http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/comets/article_1684_1.asp Sky and Telescope:  &quot;A Surprise Comet in the Dawn&quot; (Accessed 2/27/06)] *[http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/~gp/asas/asas_c2006.html Comet Data and Images from Warsaw University ] *[http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap060303.html Featured on NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day]  [[Category:Comets|Pojmański]]  [[fr:Comète Pojmański]] [[pl:C/2006 A1 Pojmański]] [[sk:Kométa Pojmanski]]</text>     </revision>

The details of Spivak's birth are unclear. Some sources place it in the [[Ukraine]] in 1907, and say that his family emigrated to settle in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] while he was a child. Others place his birth in New Haven two years earlier, in 1905.  What is certain is that he learnt to play trumpet when he was ten years old, and played in his [[high school]] band, going on to work with local groups before joining [[Don Cavallaro]]'s orchestra.  He played with [[Phil Sprecht]]'s band for most of 1924 to 1930, then spent time with [[Ben Pollack]] (1931&amp;ndash;1934), the Dorsey brothers (1934&amp;ndash;1935), and [[Ray Noble]] (1935&amp;ndash; 1936). He spent 1936 and 1937 mostly working as a studio musician with [[Gus Arnheim]], [[Glenn Miller]], [[Raymond Scott]]'s radio orchestra, and others, followed by periods with [[Bob Crosby]] (1938), [[Tommy Dorsey]] (1938&amp;ndash;1939), and [[Jack Teagarden]] (1939).  Finally, with the encouragement and financial backing of Glenn Miller, he formed his own band in November 1939.  Though it failed within a year, he tried again shortly afterwards, this time taking over an existing band ([[Bill Downer]]'s) and  making a success of it.  Spivak's band was one of the most successful in the 1940s, and survived until 1959.  Spivak's experience playing with jazz musicians had little effect on his own band's style, which was straight dance music, made up mainly of ballads and popular tunes.  Spivak himself (known as &quot;Cheery, Chubby Charlie&quot;) had always been noted and used for his tone rather than for any improvisational ability.  A number of the band's musicians were to make names for themselves, including drummer [[Davey Tough]], bassist [[Jimmy Middleton]], trumpeter [[Les Elgart]], trombonist [[Nelson Riddle]], and singers [[Garry Stevens]], [[June Hutton]], [[Tommy Mercer]], [[Jimmy Saunders]], and [[Irene Daye]] (who had sung with [[Gene Krupa]], and whom Spivak married in 1950).  Riddle was also responsible for many of the band's arrangements, together with [[Sonny Burke]].  When the Spivak orchestra broke up, he went to live in [[Florida]], where he continued to lead a band until illness led to his temporary retirement in 1963.  On his recovery, he continued to lead large and small bands, first in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], then in [[South Carolina]]; in [[Greenville, South Carolina]] in 1967 he led a small group featuring his wife as vocalist.  She died in 1971 after years of fighting cancer.  Spivak continued to play and record until his death.  ==Discography== *1958: ''Pinciana'' (Design) *1985: ''Charlie Spivak and his Orchestra'' (Ranwood) *2002: ''Dance Date'' (Collectors Choice Music)  ==Sources and external links== *[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:r1uw6j8h71r0~T1 Charlie Spivak] &amp;mdash; brief biography by Scott Yanow, for AllMusic. *[http://www.parabrisas.com/d_spivakc.php Charlie Spivak] &amp;mdash; biography from ''Solid!'' *{{findagrave|10285230}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Spivak, Charlie}} [[Category:1982 deaths]] [[Category:American trumpeters]] [[Category:American bandleaders]] [[de:Charlie Spivak]]</text>     </revision>

Throughout the book Kepesh fights with himself. Part of him wishes to give in to bodily desires, while the other part of him wants to be rational. Kepesh, a literature professor, compares his plight with that of fictional characters such as [[Gregor Samsa]] in Kafka's novella ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'' and Kovalyov in [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s short story &quot;[[The Nose]]&quot;. Throughout the novel, he describes the various sexual and physical feelings he has while people handle him, while initiating sex with his girlfriend, and while he is alone.  {{PhilipRoth}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Breast}} [[Category:1972 novels]] [[Category:Novels by Philip Roth]] [[Category:Shapeshifting in fiction]]</text>     </revision>

After intensive war service at sea, Rayner became a writer, a farmer, and a successful designer and builder of small sailing craft - his first being the Westcoaster; his most successful being the glass fibre [[gunter]] or Bermudian rigged twin keel Westerly 22 from which evolved similar &quot;small ships&quot; able to cross oceans while respecting the expectations, in terms of comfort, safety and cost, of a burgeoning family market keen to get to sea.  Denys Rayner was born in Muswell Hill in a Georgian house, on the outskirts of London, to Francis (née Parker) and Arthur Rayner, a master electrical engineer, who became a commodity broker moving with his family to [[West Kirby]] on the [[Wirral Peninsula]] and sending his son to [[Repton School]] between 1921 and 1924. [[Flat feet]] kept Denys from entering the Royal Navy but not from pursuing a successful naval career. In October 1925, he joined HMS Eaglet, Mersey Division [http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.2801] of the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] [http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.2721] as a part-time midshipman with time to pursue his interest in exploring the rocky coast of the Western Highlands in a small boat of his own design.  As an eight-year-old prep school boy, at the height of the [[First Battle of the Atlantic]], Rayner was disappointed to be beaten for drawing an &quot;infernal&quot; U-boat sinking device in a school geometry book. &quot;Diagrammatically portrayed, this spoiled the page - I can see that now&quot;  wrote the adult Rayner in the preface of his book 'Escort: The Battle of the Atlantic' (1955). At school Rayner, impressed that an uncle by marriage was an officer on &quot;a real destroyer&quot;, sketched a &quot;continuous border of destroyers&quot; in the margins of his school books. In later school years came &quot;an endless stream of model destroyers...which really floated and were fitted with systems of propulsion...&quot;('Escort' p.19).   ==Battle of the Atlantic== [[Image:HMTLochTulla.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Rayner's sketch of ''HMT Loch Tulla'']]&quot;I had already packed my bags, set my affairs in order and seen to the laying up of my yacht&quot; wrote Rayner of his actions four days before the outbreak of WW2 ('Escort' p.28).  By 1939, partly as a result of a recognition by others of his gift for leadership and partly by insisting on specialising in navigation rather than gunnery, against standard advice to RNVR officers wishing advancement in the Royal Navy, Rayner qualified himself to command 14th Anti-Submarine Group comprising HMTs ''Loch Tulla'', ''Istria'', ''Regal'', ''Brontes'' and ''Davey'', a unit of [[Naval trawler|armed trawlers]] patrolling the notoriously dangerous waters surrounding the main fleet base of [[Scapa Flow]] - a 6 by 20 mile stretch of sea between Scotland and the Orkneys where a high spring ebb can flow 8 knots against a westerly gale. His 'flag' was aboard HMT ''Loch Tulla'' for whom Rayner selected skipper Lang - a Devon trawlerman he describes as knowing things &quot;about the way of a ship which no one not trained in sail could have understood&quot; ('Escort' p.30).  In September 1940 Rayner, falling for her looks on his way to another command, used all his skills of persuasion to get the command of the first long fo'c'sle corvette, HMS ''Verbena'' (Pennant K85), a [[Flower class corvette]].[http://www.fcca.demon.co.uk/] [[Image:HMSVerbena.jpg|thumb|right|250px|HMS Verbena]] On ''Verbena'', the nickname 'Ben', which stayed with him for the rest of his life, was used as Rayner's call sign ('Escort' p.113). ''Verbena'' embarked on convoy duties between different escort groups including months in the South Atlantic. In the Indian Ocean heading for Karachi in May 1942 her boilers gave out as a result of constant high speed work and lack of cleaning and she had to be towed the last few hundred yards to a berth in Bombay for refit. After some months in India, where he made a number of horseback treks, Rayner and his crew came home.  Just after Christmas 1942, he was given the lead of an escort group, in command of the destroyer HMS ''Shikari'', becoming one of the first RNVR officers in the Royal Navy, along with Cmdr E.N.Wood of HMS ''Atherstone'' a year earlier, to be so promoted. In October 1943 he was given command of HMS ''Warwick'' (D25), surviving her sinking off Trevose Head [http://www.hmscavalier.org.uk/D25/] on 20 Feb 1944 when she was torpedoed, with the loss of 90 of her crew, by the submarine [[U-413]] commanded by Kapitänleutnant Gustav Poel [http://uboat.net/men/poel.htm]. He was picked up with other survivors by the steam trawler ''Lady Luck'' skippered by Victor Crisp. Instead of taking 'survivor's leave' after this experience, which had included being in the water as depth charges from a destroyer in pursuit of the U-boat exploded close by, Rayner, pressing Admiral [[Max Horton]] for &quot;a destroyer with two funnels&quot;, was given command of the Argent Class frigate, HMS ''Highlander'' - &quot;best-loved&quot; ('Escort' p. 242) of his wartime commands - and the leadership of an escort group that included two more vessels of the same type. Towards the end of 1944 he was appointed senior officer of a support group of Castle Class corvettes - 30th Escort Group - in command of ''[[HMS Pevensey Castle]]'' (K449) and including HMS ''Portchester Castle'' (later to 'play' HMS ''Saltash Castle'' in [[the Cruel Sea (film)|''The Cruel Sea '']]), ''Launceston Castle'' and ''Kenilworth Castle''.  Rayner's DSC was announced in the [[London Gazette]] of [[29 December]] [[1940]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34763|supp=yes|startpage=3|date=29 December 1939|accessdate=2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; dated [[1 January]] [[1940]], for the &quot;hard and perilous task of sweeping the seas clear of enemy mines, and combating submarines&quot; while commanding the trawler ''Loch Tulla''. On [[26 September]] [[1941]] it was announced that he had been [[mentioned in despatches]] (MID) 'for good services in action against enemy submarines' while commanding HMS ''Verbena''.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35289|startpage=5638|date=26 September 1941|accessdate=2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[23 March]] [[1943]] the Gazette announced the award of the RNVR officers' decoration, VRD.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35951|startpage=1375|date=23 March 1943|accessdate=2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On [[25 May]] [[1945]] he was awarded a bar to his DSC &quot;for courage, skill and perseverance ... in successful operations against enemy submarines.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37098|supp=yes|startpage=2711|date=25 May 1945|accessdate=2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rayner was credited with the sinking of one U-Boat on 11 November 1944 - U-1200, commanded by Hinrich Mangels, &quot;to pay me back for ''Warwick''&quot; ('Escort' p.221)[http://uboat.net/boats/u1200.htm]. In an escort group action the fatal depth charges were dropped by [[HMS Launceston Castle (K397)|HMS ''Launceston Castle'' (K397)]] under Lieut. R.M.Roberts, DSC, RNVR.  [[Image:wintergale.jpg|270px|thumb|left|Typical winter gale in the North Atlantic]] Rayner, though at the time given credit for sinking or damaging an unidentified U-Boat on 22 May 1941' [http://www.unithistories.com/officers/RNVR_officersR.html], had doubts even then, as he had about an earlier incident ('Escort' pp.40-41) while in charge of 14th Anti-Submarine Group on HMT ''Loch Tulla'', sailing towards Scapa Flow. He writes of picking up a strong asdic signal north of the Humber on the UK east coast, a depth charging exercise and a pool of oil, and later (p.51) he mentions “thinking” that his first DSC, announced on 1 January 1940, was “probably” for this action “off Flamborough Head”. He was uncertain whether this involved a genuine sinking, writing of the greater “difficulty” of damaging the “pressure hull” of a “modern submarine”. Later (pp.92-94) Rayner refers to an action on 22-23 May 1941 when, on HMS ''Verbena'', he engaged a U-boat on the surface after it had torpedoed the Dutch tanker ''Elusa'' and surfaced to inspect the burning wreck. The U-boat dived. Rayner depth charged a strong asdic contact, saw oil on the surface, lost contact and guided HMS ''Churchill'', with deeper depth charges, to the same target, both ships remaining in the area until dawn on the 24th May 1941. In the back inside cover of 'Escort' Rayner's map of Western Approaches shows the cross-swords symbol of an engagement and the words &quot;U-boat damaged by ''Verbena'' 22.4.41'. Many years later - 2006 -  Gudmundur Helgason, researcher of the Battle of the Atlantic [http://uboat.net] points out that ''Elusa'' was sunk by U-93 [http://uboat.net/boats/u93.htm] &quot;which certainly survived the attack&quot; adding that &quot;there were lots of those attacks reported (often with seemingly very convincing evidence at the time) that failed to sink or even damage an U-boat.  Since 1955 there have been loads of revisions of U-boat fates, almost to this day even.&quot;   Returning to base at [[Derry]] - after the sinking of U-1200, HMS ''Pevensey Castle's'' steering broke in a northerly gale off the mouth of the [[River Foyle]].  Rayner nearly lost his ship on the long sandy spit leading to Magilligan Point before hand steering was connected. He writes that at this point &quot;The candle was burned out&quot; (Escort, p.230). He sought three weeks leave of Max Horton who then posted him, in the months before [[V-E Day]], to a senior staff role with Channel Command, Portsmouth, in the tunnel complex of Fort Southwick [http://www.portsdown-tunnels.org.uk/index.html] behind Portsmouth Harbour ('Escort' pp.232-241). Here, overseeing radar guided plots from deep underground in a way that would have been impossible at the start of the campaign, Rayner applied his specialist experience to the deployment of a large force of anti-submarine warships in the closing months of the war. Rayner speaks in 'Escort' ('Escort' pp.235-236) of his respect for one of his colleagues at the fort - First Officer Audrey Faith Parker, OBE, [[Women's Royal Naval Service|WRNS]] - for the seafaring experience she brought to her operational work. It was to her and her husband Gordon that Rayner, in 1946, after a stint as temporary commander of a Naval Air station at Kirkistown near Cloughy on the east coast of Northern Ireland, sold his yacht, laid up in north Wales for the duration, and moved his household to the first of several farms in the English [[home counties]].  During a campaign that had lasted from 1939 to 1945, Rayner's youngest son, Vyvyan, reckoned (in April 2006) that his father took &quot;as little as four or five weeks home leave in the whole period.&quot; After 24 years with the 'wavy navy' Rayner retired from the RNVR in 1949.  ==Writer== [[Image:Raynerauthor.jpg|thumb|right|Rayner as author]]Having written features in the yachting press before the war, Rayner's career as an author really began in 1955 with a personal account of 'his' war, called 'Escort: the Battle of the Atlantic' published by Kimber, reissued by the Naval Institute Press (1999). He would have been the first to admit the difficulty of discerning the thread of his own experiences in a conflict that ran for the duration of WW2, involved the loss of 63,000 Allied sailors and airmen, 30,000 merchant seamen and 43,000 U-boat sailors (White, D.F. 2006). It was only because Captain S.W.Roskill DSC, RN, official historian of the War at Sea, became a family friend in the 1950s, and, over a merry evening of food and drink in the Rayner household, succeeded in overcoming Rayner's inhibitions on the subject, that the latter put pen to paper to record his particular experiences of that gigantic campaign. Except that for Rayner the sea was &quot;neither cruel nor kind&quot;, there are parallels between the war he describes in 'Escort' and that of the fictional Commander Ericson in [[Nicholas Monsarrat]]'s enormously successful post-war novel [[The Cruel Sea (novel)|The Cruel Sea]] published at almost the same time as Rayner's book. In his editor's foreword to 'Escort', Stephen Roskill writes of Rayner's authority to speak on his subject:  &quot;I know of no other officer, let alone one of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, who served continuously for more than five years in command of escort vessels; nor of any other who graduated from a trawler at the very beginning to a corvette, then to a small destroyer, and finally to command of a group of the new and greatly improved war-built escort vessels.&quot; Mike Raymond of the Flower Class Corvette's Association [http://www.fcca.demon.co.uk/] reports a portrait of Rayner 'with pipe and beard' in the frontispiece of 'Escort' - the picture at the start of this article emphasising this is more biography than history. Yet a 10 year perspective, enabled Rayner in 1955, to weave his and his men's experiences into a larger account of the Battle of the Atlantic, recording, for example, a fleeting and enticing glimpse of the chief protagonist in a four day sea battle that began with the sinking of Britain's finest warship and closed with the destruction of a German battleship that ended Hitler's use of large surface raiders against allied convoys. While escorting the homeward-bound convoy SC 31, on board HMS ''Verbena'' in company with Commander Bostock of HMS ''Churchill'', Rayner spotted a big ship on the horizon hurrying southward: &quot;... she was hull down and difficult to identify. I made to ''Churchill'', 'Are you reporting what I think I see?' and got back the reply, 'Better not - identification by no means certain. Might cause confusion. Gather ''Suffolk'' has the situation in hand.'&quot; ''Suffolk'' and ''Norfolk'' were cruisers following the [[German battleship Bismarck]] which, on 24 May 1941 had sunk [[HMS Hood (51)]] on which Rayner had served as a midshipman for three months in 1932. A year after 'Escort' came Rayner's first novel, the story of a prolonged duel between a U-boat and a British destroyer - ''[[The Enemy Below]]'' - adapted in 1957 for a film by [[Dick Powell]], in which the writer's destroyer HMS ''Hecate'' became the USS ''Haynes'' - in actuality USS ''Whitehurst'' - while his British captain,  John Murrell, became an American played by Robert Mitchum with Curt Jürgens playing Rayner's U-boat skipper, Kapitän von Stolberg. Powell displays Rayner's book at the start of the trailer of 'The Enemy Below'. Some of the actual experiences described in the novel and later transferred to film can be read in Rayner's low-key account of his encounter between corvettes and U-1200 off southern Ireland on 11 November 1944 between pages 224-228 of 'Escort'. In his novel 'The Long Fight'(1958) Rayner wrote about a three day ship-to-ship engagement in the Indian Ocean during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; about tank warfare in 'The Small Spark of Courage'(1959) (titled &quot;Valor&quot; in US editions of the novel), and about convoy escort duty in 'The Crippled Tanker'(1962) (titled &quot;The Long Haul&quot; in US). In 1966, with Alan Wykes, he wrote 'The Great Yacht Race', an illustrated account of a millionaires' yacht race from New York to Cowes in December 1866. Between 1961-1963 Rayner also published books on sailing, safety at sea in small craft and starting motorboating.  ==Small Boat Designer== [[Image:RobinettaYM37c.jpg|160px|thumb|left|&quot;my own designed ship&quot; 1937]] [[Image:Robinetta06.jpg|160px|thumb|left|''Robinetta'' in 1997]] Though his father was a keen 6-10 metre racing yachtsman, Rayner preferred the idea of cruising. On 6th June 1937, sailing his small boat out of [[Loch Fyne]], he records passing &quot;a ship which from the lines of her hull I think to have been the original ''Blue Dragon''... if it were, it is poetic justice that I should meet her on my first cruise in my own designed ship in Scottish waters for it was her exploits as detailed in 'The Log of the ''Blue Dragon''', by C.C.Lynam, read in &quot;the library of a midland county preparatory school&quot; that &quot;first started the sailing canker&quot; though &quot;vows then made to sail my own ship to Scotland had to wait twenty years for fruition.&quot; (p.369 Rayner 1938). Starting with an 18' open boat, and progressing via a 16' half-decked day sailer to a small converted fishing yawl, followed by a converted ex-fishing boat and then the 14 ton Tredwen barge yacht ''Pearl'' - burnt out on her moorings - Rayner was at last, in 1937, able try his hand at designing his own boat &quot;after studying the 'How To' articles in the Y.M.&quot; (''Yachting Monthly'' Feb 1937, p.334). ''Robinetta'', a 4½ ton gaff cutter, was built for him at the [[Rock Ferry]] yard of the Enterprise Small Craft Company, Birkenhead, and launched on 10 May 1937. Elected in March 1935 to the Royal Cruising Club &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.rcc.org.uk/]&lt;/sup&gt;- 'an association of yachtsmen who prefer navigation to racing and are full of passionate interests' (Arthur Ransome 1912) - Rayner set out, in summer 1937, to follow 'skipper' Lynam's wake to the Western Highlands. Lynam's ''Blue Dragon'' was a small clinker built yawl of his own design. So was Rayner's 4½ ton auxiliary gaff cutter ''Robinetta [http://robinetta.mysite.orange.co.uk/]'', built in Liverpool, from where he sailed her to the [[Firth of Clyde]]. Thus Rayner, before he was 30, (and according to a self-description in his file at the [[Royal Institution of Naval Architects]] (RINA)) became an amateur yacht designer and experienced small boat sailor. Between 1937 and 1938 Rayner completed two short cruises in ''Robinetta'', sometimes with his wife - &quot;E&quot; - and sometimes with RNVR comrades, Dick Taudevin and W.H.Simcoe, writing meticulous logs of intricate exploration of sea lochs with the added excitement of swift and sometimes rough open water passages, including encounters with overfalls and squalls, entranced by the scenery of these complicated shores. These pleasures ceased abruptly with the start of the war. ''Robinetta'' was laid up on chocks for the duration at a yard in Beaumaris, N.Wales, and sold in 1946. After the long war at sea Rayner moved with his family to  a farm at Hook near Basingstoke in Hampshire, and then to another farm near Burghclere, south of Newbury in Berkshire, and gave his attention to farming, horse riding and writing. In 2006 the owner of their old home, Earlstone Manor Farm, recalls accounts of Denys and Elizabeth Rayner's children's &quot;extraordinary and happy childhood here, and the huge generosity of the Rayners, who took in old shell-shocked warriors, German Jewish refugee children, and the unhappy son of a British fascist leader, who were all cared for, loved and given security, at a time when conditions were still very primitive here and the family themselves extremely deprived.&quot;  At Earlstone the Rayners were neighbours to the Roskills, and it was Captain S.W.Roskill who encouraged his neighbour to write down his recollections of the war. Rayner's eldest son recalls that, as a result, his father &quot;started thinking about boats, the sea, and boat design all over again&quot;. Publishing 'Escort', and then 'The Enemy Below', Rayner &quot;gradually morphed back to where he had always wanted to be - in yacht design&quot;. He built his younger son a dingy to row on a local lake. &quot;When it was finished&quot;, says Paul Vyvyan, &quot;I was too big for it.&quot; So his dad acquired a small yacht - a Mystic, sail number 2, designed by Robert Tucker from C. E. Clark Boat Builders at Cornubia Yacht Yard at [[Cowes]] called ''Orchid'' - ostensibly for the boy, but he called it &quot;our ship&quot;, making her easier to sail by adding a new stern.  In the late 1950s, a local manufacturer of plywood caravans asked Rayner to design a plywood dinghy to be offered with each caravan. As result of this collaboration Rayner started the Beacon Boat Company at a redundant turnery workshop in Donnington, a village on the [[River Lambourn]] north of Newbury, and applied all his enthusiasm and practicality to building and selling small family sailing boats of distinctive design. [[Image:Westcoaster.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Rayner's Westcoaster 1959]] [[Image:Westcoaster with bowsprit.jpg|160px|thumb|left|Westcoaster ''Zephyros'' with added bowsprit, circa 1964]] Wartime advances in new bonding techniques had made plywood reliable even when constantly immersed in sea water. Using mahogany frames and the new [[marine plywood]] laminated with resorcinol glues, Rayner marked his return to the sea by building a 20 foot hard chine bilge keel gunter rigged sloop - the Westcoaster - designed initially for a customer wishing to navigate the difficult waters and scarce harbours of the [[Bristol Channel]], where Rayner had been torpedoed in 1944. Rayner gave the Westcoaster &quot;sitting head room for tall men&quot; - rare in yachts so small - while ingeniously camouflaging the reverse sheer needed for such generous accommodation by carrying the decks out to the sides of the boat as he had with ''Robinetta'' 20 years earlier. Similarly all the Westcoaster's running rigging came back to the cockpit making her easy to handle single-handed. He sailed and demonstrated the first of such yachts, painted a rich royal international blue - often called Oxford Blue - enthusing about its good looks, its affordability, its practicality for weekend &quot;pottering&quot; and fitness for deeper waters despite a draft of no more than 2'3&quot; (70cm). This design ensemble was topped by Rayner's preference for the [[gunter]] rig, its short mast, compared to a Bermudian, making it easier to tow on a trailer, to lower and raise, for the bridges of inland waterways, as well as allowing a swift reef - by lowering the boom - in a squall. Rayner also wrote that he valued the greater 'lifting' quality of a gaff or gunter mainsail as compared to the Bermudian main, prior to the wider use, with that rig, of masthead Genoa's - headsails of greater area than the mainsail - which in Rayner's view, in 1962, was 'the herald of rigs to come' with 'great aerodynamic efficiency and with enormous lift!', and returning, in effect, &quot;to the lateen-shaped loose-footed sails of the Mediterranean but with a taut forestay replacing the heavy lateen yard...&quot; ('Small Boat Sailing' p.43) A small number of Westcoasters were later modified by the addition of a small [[bowsprit]], with the cutter rig giving an even greater sail area.  Bilge or twin keels, a concept for many more years unfamiliar in America, allowed a boat to take the ground upright on a tripod comprising keels and a sturdy skeg, manoeuvre in shallow water, load and tow easily behind a family saloon, and be conveniently launched. Thus Rayner, developing a concept pioneered in 1922 by a fellow member of the RCC, Arthur Balfour, later [[Lord Riverdale]][http://www.rina.org.uk/showpubl.pl?id=5900&amp;n=565], and became a key player in the expanding field of affordable chine plywood yachts, brilliantly popularised by Robert Tucker's [http://www.tucker-designs.com/about.html] Mystic, Debutante and Silhouette. Such a vessel could navigate canals and shallow estuaries including short-cuts through swatchways, take the ground safely and 'look after her crew' in hard weather, close to and off shore. It was a specification aimed at the innovative concept of 'family sailing', creating, and responding to, the enthusiasm, pockets and holidays of a post-war generation unused to enjoying the sea as a place for recreation and adventure.   [[Image:DAR Corvette.jpg‎|thumb|220px|left|Rayner's 'Corvette' 1961]][[Image:Danica2.jpg|thumb|220px|right|'Danica', Hardway, Gosport]] In 1961, Rayner's Westcoaster was briefly followed by the rotund, though equally seaworthy, Corvette - a 5 ton sloop with full standing headroom. The problem he solved with this 'prototype' was to find a way of bending a marine-ply shell in two dimensions, creating a stronger and more attractive hull, on which the hard chine that had characterised plywood yachts including his Westcoaster, was so softened as to make it almost invisible. Rayner's people did this, under his direction, by steaming ply and laminating thinner sheets to achieve a compound bend of the necessary thickness. Refining the twin ballast keels of the Westcoaster, Rayner gave the Corvette - called ''Danica'' by her owner the broadcaster [[Jack Hargreaves]] - hydrofoil sectioned twin keels, flat on the outside and curved on the inside and very slightly toed in. As well as serving the same function as fin keels, the leeward moulded bilge keel used the [[Bernoulli's principle]], to resist leeward drift as the boat heeled on a beat. Hargreaves' stepson with a companion, Chris Jameson, as her skipper, proved ''Danica'' by taking her through France by river and canal and on through the [[Mediterranean]] to [[Athens]], returning via the [[Bay of Biscay]] where she successfully weathered F10 [[gale force]] winds (September 1962), but her construction costs focused Rayner's attention on the emerging technology of glass reinforced plastic (GRP).   Having founded Beacon Boats Co. Ltd. to make and sell Westcoasters - about 60 altogether - and then the Corvette, Rayner experimented with a new enterprise making GRP sailing dinghys. From this temporary project he embarked on the factory manufacture of an ideal family sailing boat expanding, in 1963, to larger premises - temperature-and-humidity-controlled - as the firm of Westerly Marine Construction Ltd., at Hambleden Road, Waterlooville near Portsmouth on the [[Solent]], with himself as Chief Designer, having become, in 1964, an Associate of the RINA. He recruited as his directors Kenneth Bates, Micheal C.B.Hurd and David G.M.Sanders and Kenneth Todd, while Dodie Walker in Sales was regarded as integral to an enterprise Rayner was determined should attract customers who cared as much about his boats' interior comfort and convenience as their sailing qualities, for which Rayner sought Lloyd's certification. Two skilled boatbuilders - affectionately esteemed by Rayner as 'the walrus' and 'the carpenter' - were recruited to do the vital job of building the pattern moulds basic to GRP production. GRP was still so recent that he had to be satisfied with a Lloyd's Series Production Certificate affirming that the 4½ ton Westerly 22 - the company's first design - had been build under Lloyd's supervision including inspections and tests of hull strength and the factory conditions under which the moulded fibre glass used in construction went through the process, key to its long term integrity, of curing. Knowing that GRP yachts had not been around long enough to arrive at a proper assessment by Lloyd's of their durability, Rayner added exacting standards of his own to his designs, explaining why, after 40 years, such boats are still trusted by their owners.[http://www.westerly-owners.co.uk/] [[Image:Landfall66.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Westerly 22's Barbados landfall on 5 Jan 1966]]  Westerly Marine Construction Ltd. grew to be Britain's biggest yacht building company, and during the 1970s, a leader in family yachts. When Rayner was overseeing the construction of his brilliant little Westerly 22, he strengthened his friendship with Jack Hargreaves, who, as an enthusiastic populariser of  &quot;messing about in boats&quot;, filmed ''Young Tiger'' - W22 68 - departing the Solent for America. Rayner's letter, dated 14 December 1965, awaiting her young skipper, Hargreaves' stepson, at a poste restante in Bridgetown [[Barbados]], read &quot;Welcome to the Caribbean and well done! I think this is a justified remark because if you do not get this letter you won't have done so well! I am so glad you have Susanna with you. I shall of course calm down anyone who gets jumpy because I have complete confidence in you and the boat.&quot; ''Young Tiger'', crewed by Simon Baddeley and Sue Pulford, telegramed news  of her arrival at [[Bridgetown]] on 5 January to Rayner at the 1966 [[London Boat Show]] with the words &quot;EASY 29 DAYS. SIMON&quot;. They had sailed 2900 miles from the [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] to [[Barbados]] in 29 days. Peter Guinness, Rear-Commodore of the Royal Cruising Club, in awarding the RCC Challenge Cup, wrote of a winning cruise that ended in [[Miami]] USA on 17 April 1966  &quot;in a small, or even very small, ship&quot;. (RCC Journal p.xi. 1967)  ==Achievement== Having led men and commanded ships in the [[second Battle of the Atlantic]], undoubtedly the most protracted and one of the most crucial of Britain's WW2 campaigns, since it was about control of our island supply lines, Denys Rayner, who described himself, in his biographical account of the war in the Atlantic, as an 'amateur sailor', gave himself as much to the peace that followed, as he had to the war that won it.  [[Image:AdmiraltyBayBequia.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Young Tiger'' at [[Bequia]] 1966]] He died of cancer in January 1967 having seen his first two fibreglass designs - a Westerly 22 and a Westerly 25 (''Lonesome Traveller'' owned by Ann and Slade Penoyre) - sailed across the Atlantic by relatively inexperienced seafarers of the kind he dreamed of encouraging to navigate wisely in deep waters. The photo of ''Young Tiger'' shows many of the qualities Rayner sought for his Westerly 22 - a shipshape 'baggywrinkled' small craft for everyman moored close to palm trees overhanging a shallow Caribbean beach after an uneventful 29 day crossing of the Atlantic Ocean crewed by two student friends.  Rayner's guidebooks for such adventurers include 'Safety in Small Craft', Coles, Harrap, De Graff (1961) and 'Small Boat Sailing', Collins Nutshell Books (1962). Seacraft technologies, especially navigational aids, have been transformed since these books were written, yet they contain timeless wisdom about taking a small ship to sea and bringing her home - without fuss. In 'Safety in Small Craft' Rayner writes: “In any reasonable weather it is the diminutive size of the yacht which makes long passages under sail such thrilling affairs, and one of the reasons why I, for one, find the smallest possible craft the most rewarding” as well, he added, as costing less.  Ben Rayner's greatest peace time contribution lay in his approach to designing, building and selling such small craft. A fascination with making model destroyers at school evolved into the making of ''Robinetta'' in which for a few years he voyaged for pleasure - a pleasure which, after his long war service, he made available to thousands. Starting with ''Robinetta'' - based in 2006 on the [[River Orwell]] near Harwich and still sailing [http://www.eastcoastclassics.co.uk/index.htm], and then the rebuilt ''Orchid'' to share with his youngest son, Rayner graduated via the one-off Corvette to the Westerly 22, to the Westerly 25, the Westerly 30, the Windrush (a re-worked W25), and the Nomad (a re-worked W22). Applying the husbandry, and inventiveness, that characterised his years as a professional sailor, Rayner applied design and techniques, including the crucial process of curing now recognised as so vital to enduring fibre glass construction (du Plessis, H., 2006 4th ed.), to products that sold themselves. In the recent words of one of his sons, &quot;He was delighted when the butcher, the baker and candlestick maker arrived at the [[London Boat Show]] in the early 60s and put down deposits in cash. Boats at that time were produced by 12 men at 6 vessels per annum. With 12 men we built 50 a year. Their yachts cost £6,000. Ours were on a trailer for £1800.&quot;  But if these small craft were swiftly made and so affordable, none left Rayner's factory unfit for the sea, of which he wrote &quot;neither cruel nor kind ...

His last home, where he moved in late 1964, was Quarry Farm, West Meon, Hants. He married Isabelle Elizabeth (née Board) in 1933.

Homeric Rhytion was probably at ''Rotasani Kefala'' near the modern village of Rotasi (near [[Pyrgos]], south-east of the [[Mesara Plain]]) The city continued to be independent until the [[Hellenistic]] period. According to [[Strabo]], it then came under the rule of Gortys and declined. The town is also mentioned by [[Nonnos]], [[Pliny the Elder]] and  [[Stefanos Byzantios]].   Rhytion remained inhabited, although insignificant, until the Byzantine period, until, according to [[Claudius Aelianus]], the citizens were forced to leave by an insect plague.

Between October 1915 and February 1916, nine marches were held starting from various points in the state; the most notable was the first march from Gilgandra, known as the Cooee march. There was also a similar march in south-eastern Queensland.  In 1918, in an effort to promote recruitment, another march was staged, but this was less spontaneous and the marchers in fact traveled by train.  The marches were called &quot;snowball marches&quot; in the hope that like a [[snowball effect|snowball rolling down a hill]] will pick up more snow, gaining more mass and surface area, and picking up even more snow as it rolls along, the marchers would also collect more marchers as they progressed to the recruiting depot.  == Background == The [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] was formed promptly on the declaration of [[World War I]] as a volunteer force; many men signed up immediately. From mid-June 1915 there was a substantial increase in recruitment, as state-based Parliamentary recruiting committees were formed and became active in towns, boroughs and shires.  In June 1915 the [[George Pearce|Minister for Defense]] set recruitment goals at 5,300 men per month in order to maintain the forces fighting at [[Gallipoli]].   This target was exceeded in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] when 21,698 men enlisted in that month, the largest number from any state during the war. The campaign in New South Wales by contrast was disappointing for state leaders — especially so in light of interstate rivalry between the two neighbors. &lt;!-- what were these initial disappointing recruitment numbers?--&gt; It was suggested by the [[Premiers of New South Wales|Premier of New South Wales]], [[William Holman]], that one of the reasons New South Wales was not meeting the targets was because the military authorities were not ready to accept the men at the time they offered to enlist and told them to come back later. &lt;!-- who was he, he was the leader of the Government of the State of NSW- was this true or was he making excuses for poor NSW recruiting numbers?  I suspect that it was indeed true but I am surprised that the practice was limited to NSW and should not have accounted for the difference in recruitment rates between states--&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;RobsonAIFRecruitment&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Robson | first = L.L. | authorlink = Leslie Lloyd Robson  | year = 1970, paperback 1982 | title = The First A.I.F.: A study of its recruitment 1914-1918 | publisher = Melbourne University Press | location = Carlton, Victoria, Australia | id = ISBN 0-522-84237-2 |pages=p. 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In response to these embarrassing recruitment shortfalls, some New South Wales residents launched a series of '[[snowball effect|snowball]]' recruiting marches, which were intended to encourage men to enlist through the marchers' example.  The first march was a locally based initiative led by the captain of the local [[Rifle Club]] in October 1915; eight other marches were known to have taken place over the next four months. Military authorities were initially ambivalent about the marches; they were not certain whether or not the men should march with rifles, when their pay would start, and who would clothe or feed them.  Along the route however, local communities fed and housed the men, and the marches gained tremendous publicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;RobsonAIFRecruitment&quot;/&gt; About 1,500 men marched in total, and they are credited by some sources with persuading anywhere from two to three times that number to enlist as a result.&lt;ref name=&quot;RobsonAIFRecruitment&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref  name=&quot;AWMRcrtngMarches&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/recruiting_march/index.htm  | title = Recruiting Marches 1915-1916 | work = Australian War Memorial Encyclopaedia | publisher = Australian War Memorial | accessdate = 2006-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- any after-effects or other retrospective analysis? what happened after 1916?

They marched via [[Harefield, New South Wales|Harefield]], [[Junee, New South Wales|Junee]], [[Illabo, New South Wales|Illabo]], [[Bethungra, New South Wales|Bethungra]], [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] and [[Wallendbeen, New South Wales|Wallendbeen]]. At Wallendbeen on [[December 9]], the Governor-General addressed the marchers.  After Wallendbeen, they marched via [[Nubba, New South Wales|Nubba]] to [[Murrumburrah, New South Wales|Murrumburrah]] and the next day they were at [[Harden, New South Wales|Harden]]. They then marched through [[Galong, New South Wales|Galong]], [[Binalong, New South Wales|Binalong]] and [[Bowning, New South Wales|Bowning]] to [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]].  From Wagga Wagga to Yass was a total of  132 miles, the march travelled at an average of 8.8 miles per day.  As with other marches, the men were fed and feted by the local population; at Murrumburrah, for instance, donations included 114 puddings and 9 sheep to be baked gratis by the local bakers, 200 loaves of bread, 850 potatoes and 30 dozen eggs.  They marched to [[Campbelltown, New South Wales|Campbelltown]] via [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]]. The Kangaroo recruits travelled from Campbelltown into Sydney by train arriving on [[7 January]] [[1916]] with somewhere between 210 and 230 recruits. It had been decided that this recruitment drive would finish at Campbelltown so that a country contingent could be created. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woolaroo.com.au/yassarmistice/kangaroo.htm Yass remembers 1918 - Recruiting soldiers - The 1915 Kangaroo March&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There were reports of rowdy and drunken behaviour along the route by the marchers.

Marching under the 'Men from Snowy River' banner (now housed in the Western Front gallery at the Australian War Memorial), the recruitment march passed through the major regional centres of the [[Monaro]], with civil receptions at [[Bombala, New South Wales|Bombala]], [[Cooma, New South Wales|Cooma]], [[Queanbeyan, New South Wales|Queanbeyan]], [[Bungendore, New South Wales|Bungendore]] and [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/recruiting_march/snowy.htm| title = Men from Snowy River recruiting march | work = Australian War Memorial Encyclopaedia | publisher = Australian War Memorial | accessdate = 2006-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Although volunteers joined the 'Snowies' as they passed through smaller towns and villages, massive civil receptions at the larger centres celebratised the 'Snowy' recruits, which was intended to entice further 'eligibles' at the meetings to do likewise. Such was the case with recruit Timothy McMahon, who despite volunteering to march with the Men from Snowy River at [[Michelago, New South Wales|Michelago]], was employed by recruiting staff to dramatically 'volunteer' at several of these receptions in order to appeal to the patriotism of the crowd, and lure other volunteers into enlisting.&lt;ref&gt;J. Meridith,'The Coo-ee march, Gilgandra-Sydney, 1915', Kangaroo Press: Kenthurst[NSW], 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;   The Men from Snowy River recruitment march arrived in Goulburn on [[28 January]] [[1916]] 144 men strong. Despite the massive media attention the recruitment march received in the local press, the end result of 144 recruits was disappointing to recruiting staff who had envisaged at least 200 men &lt;ref&gt;D.

Corey later served with the [[Australian 5th Division (World War I)#Formation|55th battalion]] as a stretcher bearer, and is recognised as the only soldier in the [[British Empire]] to be awarded the [[Military Medal]] four times.  The majority of recruits who enlisted during the march later formed the 4th reinforcements of the 55th Battalion, AIF, all of which saw service on the Western front. Of the 144 men that enlisted in the march, 39 were later to be killed in action and 75 became casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm8/23_72_3/pdf/0440.pdf| title = Page from AIF Nominal Roll: 55th Infantry Battalion, 4th reinforcements | format =  | work =  | publisher = Australian War Memorial | accessdate = 2006-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Men from Snowy River recruitment march was relived during the Second World War when men retraced the original path of the 'Snowies', albeit diverting to Canberra.

They also maintain distribution centers in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[Atsugi, Kanagawa|Atsugi]], [[Japan]], and [[Espoo]], [[Finland]].  == History == The founder and owner of Solid Gold, Sissy Harrington-McGill, raised [[great dane]]s. In the early 1970s she travelled to [[Germany]] to acquire championship bloodline [[dog]]s, and while there learned that great danes bred and kept in that country were living significantly longer than those being bred and kept in the [[United States]]. She surmised that the reason for their longevity was the German practice of using more naturalistic dog foods. Upon returning home, she immediately began to do research into [[dog food]] [[nutrition]], and in 1974 developed her own formula out of natural ingredients which she named ''Solid Gold Hund-n-Flocken'' and began marketing it. == Litigation== On April 22, 1988, McGill and the corporate entity, Solid Gold Health Products for Pets, signed a consent decree of Permanent Injunction in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California (Civil No. 88-0473-GT(M)), agreeing that certain products sold by the company which purported to cure, prevent or otherwise treat [[disease]] and [[medical condition]]s in animals were, in fact, unapproved new animal drugs, and promised to cease the sales of such products.  On August 27, 1990, both Solid Gold and McGill were found in Criminal [[Contempt of Court]] for violating the Consent Decree by continuing to sell the new animal drug products (S.D. Ca. District Court, Criminal No. 90-0221-GT);  the corporation was fined $10,000 and McGill was sentenced to 179 days imprisonment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraud&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1370/is_n10_v24/ai_9246902|title=Solid Gold fraud - Solid Gold Health Products for Pets|accessdate=2007-11-23|publisher=BNET Research Center|year=1990|author=Judy Folkenberg,  Richard Nelson,  Sharon Snider|work=FDA Consumer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  == Recent== Today the company specializes in the development of foods which contain no [[preservative]]s or [[saturated fat]]s, and are made of [[USDA]] Choice [[meat]]s, and [[grain]]s like [[rice]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s and [[millet]], instead of [[wheat]], [[soy]], or [[maize|corn]] like most other manufacturers.

Please check out [[:Category:Wikipedia backlog]], and read the page about [[Wikipedia:administrators|administrators]] and the [[Wikipedia:administrators' reading list|administrators' reading list]]. ::A. I like increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of Wikipedia. As a regular user, I have cleaned up after vandalism and poorly-done good faith edits, brought new and lonely articles to a basic minimum standard, and dropped welcome messages on new users' talk pages. Making information easier to find and edit is one of my aims in editing. ::I've also been applying categorization and naming conventions where I can. I anticipate primarily helping with CfD and RM. I've tagged articles as CSD and had them done so very speedily, so I want to return the favor, where CSD apply. ::Other chores I can think of for short term include cut-and-paste move repair and merging edit histories. Once I better understand the policies, I anticipate executing the deletion and protection processes. :;Added 06.20, 27 February 2006 (UTC): I'd like to be able to update, clean up, dab, etc. the protected Main Page features, particularly links to dab pages and changes on TFA not reflected in the blurb. :;Added 19.33, 28 February 2006 (UTC), response to issues raised by oppose and neutral votes: First, thanks for your concerns. Short answer about being inexperienced with the process: &quot;Not much experience, willing to learn.&quot; ::&quot;Reverting vandalism&quot; for me mostly means keeping an eye on suspicious edits via the articles on my watchlist, and checking history for articles I read or random across. One recent example is ''[[The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants]]'', which had deletions that went unnoticed for a while. ::I don't RC patrol because it generally seems to have enough users there, admin and non-admin alike. I haven't voted in AfD/CfD because I find the consensus typically agrees with my intepretation of policies and guidelines. (Somewhere I read that if you agree with consensus, it's not necessary to vote, WP:NOT a democracy and all.) ::&quot;Executing the deletion ... processes&quot; for me means keeping the speedies speedy (minimizing backlog), and (once I better understand the process) closing debates. ::I hope this clarifies things. --[[User:Christopherlin|Christopherlin]] (fixed errors --[[User:Christopherlin|Christopherlin]] 17:06, 2 March 2006 (UTC))  :'''2.''' Of your articles or contributions to Wikipedia, are there any about which you are particularly pleased, and why? ::A. SCEhardt already pointed out WikiProject Cycling and Portal:Cycling. I'm glad the project has caught a lot of support. Through this, I found quite a few cycling articles from de: and fr: and linked these from the en: versions. This was complicated by my total lack of German ability. ::As for non-cycling articles, [[Louisiana State University]], like many Louisiana-related articles, lacked attention. The original, before [[User:Xj14y|Xj14y]] fixed it, had major POV and accuracy issues. ::Does this question include Wikinews contributions? I've got one, if it does. :;Added 19.33, 28 February 2006 (UTC): I was very pleased with [[wikinews:Colleges offering admission to displaced New Orleans students]]. It started as a simple list, much like several others popping up. I found a few that individual LiveJournal users were maintaining there. Decentralizing editing seemed like a perfect job for Wiki. What I did was make it much easier for dedicated users like Amvhoward and Ziasudra to grow this list. Anons added their own schools. I was pretty amazed at how quickly it grew to needing to be split into so many subpages.  :'''3.''' Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or do you feel other users have caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future? ::A. I can't recall any conflicts or stressful situations on Wikipedia. The closest I can think of is keeping some fan speculation out of ''[[Dead Like Me]]'' for being original research, backed up only by &quot;discussion on IMDb boards. I moved the passages to [[Talk:Dead Like Me|talk]] (twice) and explained why. That was pretty much it. ::If you can think of a conflict I've had, ask me about it here.  ::Any other questions?   :''The above discussion is preserved as an archive of the discussion.  &lt;font color=red&gt;'''Please do not modify it.'''&lt;/font&gt; Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the talk page of either [[{{NAMESPACE}} talk:{{PAGENAME}}|this nomination]] or the nominated user).

Frank Baum]]'s [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|1900 novel]], made by the [[Selig Polyscope Company]] without Baum's direct input. It was created to fulfill a contractual obligation associated with Baum's personal [[bankruptcy]] caused by ''[[The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays]]'', from which it was once thought to have been derived.  It was partly based on the [[The Wizard of Oz (1902 stage play)|1902 stage musical]], though much of the film deals with the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], who does not appear in the musical.  ==Plot==  [[Dorothy Gale]] is chased into the cornfield by the mule, Hank. She discovers in the field that the family scarecrow is alive. A cyclone appears overhead and takes Dorothy along with the mule, [[Toto (dog)|Toto]], Imogene the cow, and the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]] to [[Land of Oz|Oz]]. In Oz, they meet the [[Tin Woodman]], the [[Cowardly Lion]], [[Eureka (Oz)|Eureka]] the Kitten, [[Glinda]] the good witch, and Momba (the [[Wicked Witch of the West]]). The wicked witch captures them with her army of flying lizards and soldiers. After defeating Momba, they arrive in the [[Emerald City]] for the retirement party of the [[Wizard (Oz)|Wizard]].  ==Cast== There is no definitive proof who is in the cast, or who directed the film.  [[Otis Turner]] may have directed the film, but [[Mark Evan Swartz]] points out that it is highly unlikely that both [[Otis Turner]] and [[Bebe Daniels]] worked on the film, as they were in different parts of the country at the time (Turner in Chicago, Daniels in California), and neither were a strong impetus for travel.  Dorothy does look like contemporary photos of Daniels, which would make Turner's direction improbable. [[Michael Patrick Hearn]] disputes this, and has found ample evidence that both were in California at the time.  At any rate, that Baum knew of Turner is confirmed by his spoofery of an &quot;Otis Werner&quot; in his ''[[Aunt Jane's Nieces Out West]]'', a fictional account of his years as an [[independent filmmaker]].  Other reported cast members include [[Hobart Bosworth]], [[Robert Z. Leonard]], [[Eugenie Besserer]], [[Winifred Greenwood]], [[Lillian Leighton]], [[Olive Cox]], [[Marcia Moore (actor)|Marcia Moore]], and [[Alvin Wycoff]]. Swartz suggests Bosworth was the Scarecrow and Leonard the Tin Woodman, but photographs of the actors make this appear unlikely and suggest that Bosworth was the Wizard and Leonard the Scarecrow. Based on photographs, and assuming the cast list is correct, it appears that Cox is [[Glinda]] and Leighton is the servant who pulls out a list of Union rules. Besserer is most likely Momba, and Greenwood likely to be Aunt Em. There is quite a large cast before the camera, and it is unlikely that they will all ever be identified. [[Michael Patrick Hearn]] emphasizes that this cast list is not contemporary with the film and may have no basis in fact.  ==Production history== The character Imogene the Cow did not appear in the novel. The cow was used as a replacement for Toto the dog in the stage musical. Many of the costumes and much of the make-up in this film, though notably, not of the [[Tin Woodman]], resemble those used in the 1902 Broadway musical ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1902 stage play)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. (None of the songs in the stage show, however, were used in the later [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|MGM film]] which has become so famous.)  As is clear from the plot descriptions below, the presence of Eureka the kitten is drawn from the commingling of material from ''The Marvelous Land of Oz'' and ''Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz''--Eureka appears in the latter novel.  Long thought to be culled from footage from ''[[The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays]]'' (a [[feature length]] [[stage (theatre)|stage]] and [[film]] show created and presented by Baum in [[1908]]), this was proven not to be the case when the film was recovered.  Although the only known ''Fairylogue'' film footage has decomposed (and the interactive nature of the presentation makes the discovery of another print unlikely), the slides, script, and production stills are available (and many have been reprinted in books and magazines) and clearly from another production, which emphasized material from ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' that the descriptions of the Selig films imply was ignored.  This film, and its sequels, were created in the wake of Baum's loss of the rights to ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' and temporary licensing rights on ''The Marvelous Land of Oz'' and ''John Dough and the Cherub''.  ==Other adaptations== ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' was later followed by the sequels  ''Dorothy and the Scarecrow in Oz'', ''The Land of Oz'', and ''John Dough and the Cherub'', all 1910 and are all considered to be [[lost film]]s. Other Oz silent films include ''[[The Patchwork Girl of Oz (1914 film)]]'', ''[[The Magic Cloak of Oz]]'', and ''[[His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz]]'' (all released in 1914).  ==Sequels==  The Selig Polyscope sequels are known only from their catalog descriptions:  ===''Dorothy and the Scarecrow in Oz''=== &lt;blockquote&gt;Dorothy and the Scarecrow are now in the Emerald City. They have become friendly with the Wizard, and together with the woodman, the cowardly lion, and several new creations equally delightful, they journey through Oz -- the earthquake -- and into the glass city. The Scarecrow is elated to think he is going to get his brains at last and be like other men are; the Tin-Woodman is bent upon getting a heart, and the cowardly lion pleads with the great Oz for courage. All these are granted by his Highness. Dorothy picks the princess. -- The Dangerous Mangaboos. -- Into the black pit, and out again. We then see Jim, the cab horse, and myriads of pleasant surprises that hold and fascinate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  ===''The Land of Oz''=== &lt;blockquote&gt;The Emerald City in all its splendor with all the familiar characters so dear to the hearts of children - Little Dorothy, the scarecrow, the woodman, the cowardly lion, and the wizard continuing on their triumphal entry to the mystic city, adding new characters, new situations, and scintillating comedy. Dorothy, who has so won her way into the good graces of lovers of fairy folk, finds new encounters in the rebellion army of [[Jinjur|General Jinger]] [sic] showing myriads of Leith soldiers in glittering apparel forming one surprise after the other, until the whole resolves itself into a spectacle worthy of the best artists in picturedom. Those who have followed the two preceding pictures of this great subject cannot but appreciate &quot;The Land of Oz,&quot; the crowning effort of the Oz series.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  ===''John Dough and the Cherub''=== ==DVD release== One of the films in the 3-disc boxed DVD set called &quot;More Treasures from American Film Archives (2004)&quot;, compiled by the National Film Preservation Foundation from 5 American film archives. This film is preserved by George Eastman House, has a running time of 13 minutes and an added piano score adapted from [[Paul Tietjens]]'s music from the [[The Wizard of Oz (1902 stage play)|1902 stage play]] and performed by [[Martin Marks]].  It is also included in the 3-disc edition of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)]]'', looking slightly more battered. On this edition, [[John Thomas]] performs a compilation of Oz-related music by [[Louis F. Gottschalk]].  ==See also== *[[The Wizard of Oz (adaptations)]] — other adaptations of ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz''  ==References== ==External links== * {{imdb title|id=001463|title=The Wonderful Wizard of Oz}}  * ''[http://www.archive.org/details/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]'' download at [[Internet Archive]]  &lt;!--Split film/book article intentional - Please do not remove this comment--&gt;   {{Oz}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Wonderful Wizard of Oz, The}} [[Category:1910 films]] [[Category:Fantasy films]] [[Category:Films based on fantasy novels]] [[Category:Oz in stage and film productions]] [[Category:Black and white films]] [[Category:Silent films]] [[Category:American films]] [[Category:Short films]] [[Category:Films directed by Otis Turner]]</text>     </revision>

He is played by [[Andy Devine (English actor)|Andy Devine]].  ==About Shadrach==  Shadrach's main character traits are often uselessness, selfishness, hypocracy and a dependency on alcohol, although he can surprise with moments of sensitivity or support.  ===Arrival===  He arrived in town on the day of [[Butch Dingle]]’s funeral, and got so drunk that he fell asleep in church - infuriating his brother [[Zak Dingle|Zak]], who was grieving for his son.   ===Paternity reveal===  Zak restrained himself because he owed Shadrach; when the two men were younger, Zak had enjoyed a fling with Shadrach’s wife [[Faith Dingle|Faith]]. Unbeknownst to both men, the product of this passionate affair was Cain Dingle. Since Cain thought Shadrach was his father, he was shocked to discover the man who’d bought him up was just his uncle.   ===Bad behaviour===  The Dingles weathered this crisis, but when Zak went to [[South America]] in search of the Dingle fortune, Shadrach turned up and begged Zak’s wife [[Lisa Dingle|Lisa]] to take him in. Sticking to the Dingle code of loyalty, Lisa agreed - only for Shadrach to spend the next few months trying to get her into bed. Order was restored when Zak returned several months later, but Shadrach’s slovenly behaviour continued to provoke disgust among his clan and the neighbours alike.   A life of heavy drinking took a toll on Shadrach and his daughter [[Chastity Dingle|Chastity]] desperately worried that her father is going to die from alcoholism. In order to try and wean him off it, Chas bet Zak and Shadrach that they couldn’t stay dry for a month. Predictably, Shadrach couldn’t and spent the entire time trying to get his hands on some booze.   ===Daniel===  On August 26th 2007, Shadrach was in the church vestry and didn't realise that heavily pregnant [[Laurel Thomas]] was asleep inside the church. However, [[Emily Kirk]] had locked the church doors without realising they were in there and Laurel went into labour. Shadrach was first on the scene and rang the church bells to alert the village to the emergency and helped Laurel through her labour. When baby [[Daniel Thomas|Daniel]] was born Shadrach showed more love to Daniel than he had to any of his or Zak's children and was over the moon when Laurel asked him to be godfather. Shadrach adored his godson, surprising many; he got Daniel presents and promised to do things with him when he was older. Tragically Daniel died on February 21st 2008, leaving Shadrach devastated. Initially Shadrach blamed himself for Daniel's death as he thought that all the alcohol fumes he would have breathed upon Daniel over the last 6 months may have been the little tot's main cause of death, but stopped blaming himself with help from Laurel and Diane. Despite Daniel being dead Shadrach was still loving to him, visiting the grave every few days with flowers and even once brought one of [[Samson Dingle|Samson's]] old teddy bears to keep the tiny tot company.  In spring 2008, Laurel and Ashley learned their biological son had actually been switched at birth with the child of [[Greg Doland|Greg]] and [[Melanie Doland]]. After some months of turmoil, the court gave custody of Arthur Doland to Laurel and Ashley. Shadrach was very reluctant to see the child, as he felt this was disrespectful to Daniel's memory. On Arthur's first birthday, Laurel spoke to Shadrach and told him she'd never forget Daniel, but she also loved Arthur. When Shadrach spoke of his memories of helping her give birth to Daniel, she reminded him that was actually Arthur. This helped Shadrach make peace with the situation.  ===Genesis===  Through their shared grief, Laurel and Shadrach formed a bond, and in March 2008, Shadrach confided in Laurel that some decades earlier he'd had an affair with a woman named Shirley Pascoe. Eventually he decided to leave Faith for Shirley, but by the time he got around to seeing her again, she'd died in childbirth. Their child was Genesis Pascoe, born 21 November 1987. Shadrach allowed social services to take her and told Laurel he wished he'd taken her in.   Laurel told Chas the truth and after getting over her initial hurt and anger, Chas went with her father to social services. They learned Genesis had been adopted soon after her birth, had stayed with that family, and wanted to contact her birth father. A nervous Shadrach, with Chas' help, wrote a letter asking Genesis to contact him if she felt comfortable enough to do so. She agreed to meet Shadrach, but did not turn up. Shadrach assumed she'd changed her mind; he had no way of knowing she was fighting for her life in hospital after a car grazed her motorbike.  Shadrach finally met Genesis, now going by Gennie Walker, several weeks later, when Paddy Kirk invited her to a birthday party for Eli. A drunk Shadrach, having no idea who Gennie was, made a pass at her. Gennie was horrified when she learned his name was Shadrach, as she knew that was her father's name. Later in the party, she told Paddy that Shadrach was her father, not realising everyone would overhear when the music was suddenly switched off.  Gennie fled the house and Shadrach had to explain himself to Lisa and Zak. Soon, Gennie returned, and wanted to get to know her father. He told her about the circumstances of her birth and adoption, and they began to form a close bond. He also tried to reassure Chas, who resented the efforts he was making for his new daughter when he'd never bothered to support her.  ==Family== * Father: [[Jedediah Dingle]] (deceased) * Mother: [[Peg Dingle]] * Brothers: [[Zak Dingle]], [[Ezra Dingle]], [[Albert Dingle]], [[Caleb Dingle]], Zebediah Dingle * Wife: [[Faith Dingle]] * Daughters: [[Chas Dingle]], [[Genesis Walker]] * Grandfather: Jonah Dingle (deceased) * Great - Grandfather: Isaac Dingle (deceased) * Great - Great Grandfather: Benidiah Dingle (deceased) * Grandson: [[Aaron Livesy]] * Nephews: Nathan Dingle, [[Ben Dingle]] (deceased), [[Butch Dingle]] (deceased), [[Sam Dingle]], [[Cain Dingle]], [[Marlon Dingle]], [[Eli Dingle]] * Nieces: [[Tina Dingle]], [[Belle Dingle]], [[Mandy Dingle]], [[Lilith Dingle]], [[Delilah Dingle]] * Great Nephews: [[Luke Dingle]], [[Matthew Dingle]], [[Mark Dingle]], [[Samson Dingle]]  * Great Nieces: [[Debbie Dingle]], [[Jon Dingle]] * Great Great Niece: [[Sarah Dingle]] * Uncle: Bert Dingle * Cousin: Obadiah Dingle * First Cousin Once Removed: [[Charity Tate]] * Second Cousins: [[Debbie Dingle]], [[Noah Tate]]  {{EDDingles}}  ==External links== *[http://www.itv.com/page.asp?partid=3681 Shadrach Dingle] at [[itv.com]]  {{Emmerdale}}  [[Category:Emmerdale characters|Dingle, Shadrach]] [[Category:Wikipedia articles in need of updating]]</text>     </revision>

Zero energy buildings are gaining considerable interest as a means to cut greenhouse gas emissions and conserve energy.  Buildings use 40% of the total energy in the US and European Union.&lt;ref&gt;Baden, S., et al., [http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/pdf/FSEC-PF-396-06.pdf &quot;Hurdling Financial Barriers to Lower Energy Buildings: Experiences from the USA and Europe on Financial Incentives and Monetizing Building Energy Savings in Private Investment Decisions.&quot;] ''Proceedings of 2006 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings,'' American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, Washington DC, August 2006. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Energy. [http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/contents.html ''Annual Energy Review 2006''] 27 June 2007. Accessed 27 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  == Overview == This can be measured in different ways (relating to cost, energy, or carbon emissions) and, irrespective of the definition used, different views are taken on the relative importance of energy generation and energy conservation to achieve energy balance. Although zero energy buildings remain uncommon in [[Developed country|developed countries]], they are gaining in importance and popularity. The zero-energy approach is promoted as a potential solution to a range of issues, including reducing [[carbon dioxide|carbon emissions]], and reducing dependence on [[fossil fuel]]s. Most ZEB definitions do not include the emissions generated in the construction of the building and the embodied energy of the structure which would usually invalidate claims of reducing carbon emissions.  A building approaching zero energy use may be called a ''near-zero energy building'' or ''ultra-[[low energy house]]''. Buildings that produce a surplus of energy during a portion of the year may be known as ''[[Energy-plus-house|energy-plus buildings]]''. An energy [[Autarky|autarkic]] house is a building concept where the balance of the own energy consumption and production can be made on an hourly or even smaller basis. Energy autarkic houses can be taken off-the-grid.  ==Definitions== Despite sharing the name '''zero energy building''', there are several definitions  of what ZEB means in practice, with a particular difference in usage between North America and Europe. &lt;ref name=zebdef&gt;Torcellini et al. [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39833.pdf Zero Energy Buildings: A Critical Look at the Definition.] National Energy Renewable Laboratory (NREL). June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  ; Net zero site energy use:In this type of ZEB, the amount of energy provided by on-site [[renewable energy]] sources is equal to the amount of energy used by the building.  In the United States, “zero energy building” generally refers to this type of building.  ; Net zero source energy use:This ZEB generates the same amount of energy as is used, including the energy used to transport the energy to the building.  This type accounts for losses during [[Electric power transmission|electricity transmission]]. These ZEBs must generate more electricity than net zero site energy buildings.  ; Net zero energy emissions: Outside the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], a ZEB is generally defined as one with zero net energy emissions, also known as a ''zero carbon building'' or ''zero emissions building''. Under this definition the [[carbon emissions]] generated from on-site or off-site fossil fuel use are balanced by the amount of on-site [[renewable energy]] production.  Other definitions include not only the carbon emissions generated by the building in use, but also those generated in the construction of the building and the [[embodied energy]] of the structure. Others debate whether the carbon emissions of [[commuting]] to and from the building should also be included in the calculation.  ; Net zero cost:In this type of building, the cost of purchasing energy is balanced by income from sales of electricity to the grid of electricity generated on-site. Such a status depends on how a utility credits net electricity generation and the utility rate structure the building uses.  ; Net off-site zero energy use:A building may be considered a ZEB if 100% of the energy it purchases comes from renewable energy sources, even if the energy is generated off the site.  ; Off-the-grid:[[Off-the-grid]] buildings are stand-alone ZEBs that are not connected to an off-site energy utility facility. They require distributed renewable energy generation and  energy storage capability (for when the sun is not shining, wind is not blowing, etc).  ==Design and construction== The most cost-effective energy reduction in a building usually occurs during the design process.&lt;ref name=energypyr&gt;Vieira, R., [http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/html/FSEC-PF-401-06/ &quot;The Energy Policy Pyramid - A Hierarchal Tool For Decision Makers&quot;.], Fifteenth Symposium on Improving Building Systems in Hot and Humid Climates, July 24-26, 2006 Orlando, FL.&lt;/ref&gt;  To achieve minimal energy use, zero energy design departs significantly from conventional construction practice. Zero energy building designers typically use sophisticated 3D [[computer simulation]] tools to take into account a wide range of design variables such as building orientation (relative to the daily and seasonal position of the [[sun]]), window and door type and placement, overhang depth, insulation type and values of the building elements, air tightness ([[weatherization]]), the efficiency of heating, cooling, lighting and other equipment, as well as local climate. These simulations help the designers predict how the building will perform before it is built, and enable them to model the economic and financial implications on building [[cost benefit analysis]].  Zero Energy Buildings are usually built with significant energy-saving features.  The heating and cooling loads are often drastically lowered by using high-efficiency equipment, added [[building insulation|insulation]], high-efficiency windows, [[passive solar]] techniques, and other techniques.  These features can vary drastically between buildings in different climate zones.  Water heating loads can be alleviated by using heat recovery units on waste water, and by using high-efficiency water heating equipment.  In addition, lighting energy use can be lessened by daylighting, [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]] and [[LED lamp|LED]] lighting, and [[miscellaneous electric loads]] can be lessened by choosing efficient appliances and minimizing [[standby power]].  Zero energy buildings are often designed to make use of energy gained from other sources including [[white goods]]; for example, use refrigerator exhaust to heat domestic hot water, ventilation air and shower drain [[heat exchanger]]s, office machines and computer servers, and even body heat from rooms with multiple occupants.  These buildings make use of heat energy that conventional buildings typically exhaust outside. They may use [[heat recovery ventilation]], [[hot water heat recycling]], and [[absorption chiller]] units.  They are normally optimised to use [[passive solar]] heat gain, use [[thermal mass]] to stabilise [[diurnal]] temperature variations throughout the day, and in most climates are [[superinsulation|superinsulated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | last = Frej   | first = Anne, editor   | title = Green Office Buildings: A Practical Guide to Development   | publisher = Urban Land Institute   | year = 2005   | pages = 138-142   | isbn = 2005904468}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the technologies needed to create zero energy buildings are available [[off-the-shelf]] today.  Other unique energy-saving strategies include using [[absorption chiller]]s,  daylighting, [[combined heat and power]],&lt;ref name=zebdef/&gt;, and [[Passive cooling]].  ==Energy generation== ZEBs generate their own energy to meet their electricity and heating needs. In the case of individual houses, various [[microgeneration]] technologies may be used to provide heat and electricity to the building,  using [[solar cell]]s or [[wind turbine]]s for electricity, and [[biofuel]]s or [[solar collector]]s linked to [[seasonal thermal store]]s for space heating. To cope with fluctuations in demand, zero energy buildings are frequently connected to the [[electricity grid]], export electricity to the grid when there is a surplus, and drawing electricity when not enough electricity is being produced. Other buildings may be fully [[autonomous building|autonomous]].  Zero Energy Production, in [[commercial]] and [[industrial]] applications. Taking into account the diverse [[topography]] of each location and designing a [[renewable energy development]] approach to satisfy the production energy required to develop each product. This production energy always reduces the profitability of each facility constructed in the past. With Zero Energy Production comes the arena of placing [[Geothermal]], [[Microhydro]], [[Solar]], and [[Wind]] resources to lower the initial impact of each facilities requirement to be self sustainable using only [[sustainable energy]].  Zero-energy neighborhoods, such as the [[BedZED]] development in the [[United Kingdom]], and those that are spreading rapidly in California and China, may use [[distributed generation]] schemes. This may in some cases include [[district heating]], community chilled water, shared wind turbines, etc. There are current plans to use ZEB technologies to build entire off-the-grid cities, such as the photovoltaic-powered [[Huangbaiyu]] Sustainable Village, and the planned [[Dongtan]] Eco-City near [[Shanghai]].  A benefit of such localized energy generation is the elimination of [[electrical transmission]] and [[electricity distribution]] losses. These losses amount to about 7.2%-7.4% of the energy transferred.&lt;ref&gt;Powerwatch. [http://www.powerwatch.org.uk/energy/graham.asp Domestic Energy Use in the UK.] 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  ==The &quot;energy generation&quot; versus &quot;energy conservation&quot; debate== One of the key areas of debate in zero energy building design is over the balance between [[energy conservation]] and the distributed point-of-use generation of [[renewable energy]] ([[solar energy]], [[wind energy]], etc.). Most zero energy homes use a combination of the two strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buildingscienceconsulting.com/resources/glossary.htm “Building Science Glossary.”] Building Science Consortium.  Accessed 27 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of significant government subsidies for photovoltaic solar electric systems, wind turbines, etc., there are those who suggest that a ZEB is a conventional house with distributed renewable energy generation. Entire additions of such homes have appeared in locations such as California&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarum.com/clarum-PR3.pdf Clarum Unveils California's First Zero Energy Home Community.] 1 April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and other locations where photovoltaic (PV) subsidies are significant,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsireusa.org/ Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency (DSIRE) Home.] 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but many so called &quot;Zero Energy Homes&quot; still have utility bills.  This type of energy generation without energy conservation may not be cost effective with the current price of photovoltaic equipment (depending on the local price of power company electricity) &lt;ref name=zebeconomics&gt;P. Eiffert. [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy03osti/31977.pdf Guidelines for the Economic Evaluation of Building-Integrated Photovoltaic Power Systems]. Prepared for National Renewable Energy Laboratory. January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;, and also requires greater embodied energy and greater resources and is thus the lesser ecological approach.&lt;!--citation needed--&gt;.  For three decades, [[passive solar building design]] has demonstrated energy consumption reductions of 70% to 90% in many locations, without using any active power generation systems. With expert design, this can be accomplished with little additional new construction cost for materials over a conventional building, but very few industry experts have the skills or experience to do this. Such passive solar designs are much more cost effective than adding expensive photovoltaic panels on the roof of a conventional inefficient building.&lt;ref name=zebeconomics/&gt; A few kWh of photovoltaic panels (costing tens of thousands of U.S. dollar equivalent) may only reduce external energy requirements by 15% to 30%. A 100,000 BTU high [[seasonal energy efficiency ratio]] 14 conventional air conditioner requires over 7 kW of photovoltaic electricity while it is operating, and that does not include enough for [[off-the-grid]] night time operation. Using [[passive cooling]], and superior system engineering techniques, can reduce the air conditioning requirement by 70% to 90%, where photovoltaic electricity then becomes more cost-effective.  ==Occupant behavior== The energy used in a building can vary greatly depending on the behavior of its occupants.  Studies of identical homes in the United States have shown dramatic differences in energy use, with some homes using more than twice the energy of others.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, D., Hoak, D., Cummings, J., [http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/pdf/FSEC-CR-1742-08.pdf “Pilot Evaluation of Energy Savings from Residential Energy Demand Feedback Devices,”] Florida Solar Energy Center, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Occupant behavior can vary from differences in setting and programming [[thermostat]]s, varying levels of [[over-illumination|illumination]] and hot water, and the amount of [[miscellaneous electric load|miscellaneous electric devices]] used.&lt;ref name=energypyr&gt;Energy Pyramid Ref&lt;/ref&gt;  ==The modern evolution of zero energy buildings== The development of modern zero energy buildings became possible not only through the progress made in new construction technologies and techniques, but it has also been significantly improved by academic research on traditional and experimental buildings, which collected precise performance data for today's advanced computer models, and the engineering design decision criteria for the many differences between alternative zero energy design patterns.  ===Influential zero- and low-energy buildings===  Those who commissioned construction of Passive Houses and Zero Energy Homes (over the last three decades) were essential to iterative, incremental, cutting-edge, technology innovations. Much has been learned from many significant successes, and a few expensive failures.   The zero energy building concept has been a progressive evolution from other [[low-energy building]] designs. Among these, the Canadian [[R-2000]] and the [[Germany|German]] ''[[passive house]]'' standards have been internationally influential. Collaborative government demonstration projects, such as the superinsulated Saskatchewan House, and the [[International Energy Agency|International Energy Agency's]] ''[[IEA Task 13|Task 13]]'', have also played their part.  The 1999 side-by-side [[Florida Solar Energy Center]] Lakeland Florida demonstration project &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/research/buildings/zero_energy/lakeland/ ZEH: Lakeland, FL:Examining the Limits of Building Energy Efficiency Through Side-by-Side Testing]&lt;/ref&gt; was called the &quot;Zero Energy Home.&quot; It was a first-generation university effort that significantly influenced the creation of the U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Zero Energy Home program. George Bush's [[Solar America Initiative]] is funding research and development into widespread near-future development of cost-effective Zero Energy Homes in the amount of $148 million in 2008 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/energy.html Budget of the United States Government, FY 2008: DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY]&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/08/20050808-4.html Office of the Press Secretary (August 8, 2005)Fact Sheet: President Bush Signs Into Law a National Energy Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;  ===New-generation ZEBs===  One example of the new generation of zero energy office buildings is the 71-story '''Pearl River Tower,''' which is scheduled to open in 2009, as the Guangdong Company headquarters.  It uses both high energy efficiency, and distributed renewable energy generation from both solar and wind.  Built by Skidmore Owings Merrill LLP in Guangzhou, China&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill Pearl River Tower | url = http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=9801302 | accessdate = 2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the tower is receiving  economic support from government subsidies that are now funding many significant conventional fossil-fuel (and [[nuclear energy]]) [[energy conservation|energy reduction]] efforts.  One of the first zero-energy commercial buildings in the United States is Integrated Design Associates (IDeAs) '''Z-Squared Design Facility.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = From Zero to Net-Zero Squared  | work = Archi*tech Magazine  | publisher = Stamats Business Media  | month = January | year = 2008 | url = http://www.architechmag.com/articles/detail.aspx?contentID=5605  | accessdate = 2008-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = The Zero-Zero Hero  | work = IEEE Spectrum  | publisher = IEEE  | month = September | year = 2007 | url = http://spectrum.ieee.org/sep07/5485 | accessdate = 2008-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opened and occupied as of October 2007, this [[San Jose, California]] building was designed to meet a net-zero-energy/zero-carbon-emissions (Z-squared) target. Notably, it is a remodel of a commonplace 1960’s-era tilt-up concrete structure that once served as a corner bank. Z-squared performance was achieved through simple, affordable strategies, including daylighting, radiant heating, ground source heat pump cooling, advanced insulation and glazing and reduced [[Miscellaneous electric load|computer and appliance loads]] through careful equipment selection and wiring.    [[Googleplex]], [[Google]]'s headquarters in [[Mountain View, California]], completed a 1.6 megawatt photovoltaic campus-wide renewable power generation system. Google (and others) have developed advanced technology for major reductions in computer-server energy consumption (which is becoming a major portion of modern zero-energy commercial building design, along with daylighting and efficient electrical lighting systems).  ===ZEB development efforts===  Wide acceptance of zero energy building technology may require more government incentives or building code regulations, the development of recognised standards, or significant increases in the cost of conventional energy.  The Google photovoltaic campus, and the Microsoft 480-kilowatt photovoltaic campus relied on U.S. Federal, and especially California, '''subsidies''' and financial incentives. California is now providing $3.2 billion USD in subsidies &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gosolarcalifornia.ca.gov/ Go Solar California]&lt;/ref&gt; for residential-and-commercial near-zero-energy buildings, due to California's serious electricity shortage, frequent [[power outage]]s, and [[air pollution]] problems. The details of other American states' renewable energy subsidies (up to $5.00 USD per watt) can be found in the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsireusa.org/ Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency]&lt;/ref&gt; The Florida Solar Energy Center has a slide presentation on recent progress in this area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usda.gov/rus/electric/engineering/sem2006/lynn-pv.pdf Energy: The Grand Challenge of the 21st Century]&lt;/ref&gt;  The '''World Business Council for Sustainable Development &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbcsd.org World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)]&lt;/ref&gt;''' has launched a major initiative to support the development of ZEB.  Led by the CEO of [[United Technologies]] and the Chairman of [[Lafarge]], the organization has both the support of large global companies and the expertise to mobilize the corporate world and governmental support to make ZEB a reality. Their first report, a survey of key players in real estate and construction, indicates that the costs of building green are overestimated by 300 percent. Survey respondents estimated that greenhouse gas emissions by buildings are 19 percent of the worldwide total, in contrast to the actual value of roughly 40 percent.&lt;ref&gt;World Business Council for Sustainable Development, August 2007, [http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MjU5MTI/ ''Energy Efficiency in Buildings: Business Realities and Opportunities''] Retrieved: 2007-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;  ==Zero energy building versus green building==  The goal of [[green building]] and [[sustainable architecture]] is to use resources more efficiently and reduce a building's negative impact on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;US Environmental Protection Agency, [http://www.epa.gov/greenbuilding/pubs/about.htm &quot;Green Building,&quot;] 16 Apr. 2008.  Accessed on: 17 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Zero energy buildings achieve one green-building goal of significantly reducing energy use and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.  Zero energy buildings, however, are not necessarily green, because in order to achieve net zero energy use or carbon emissions, buildings do not require other green building practices such as reducing waste, using [[recycling|recycled]] building materials, etc.  Similarly, green building certification does not require a building to have net zero energy use, only to reduce energy use.   [[Green building]] council certification criteria (such as the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] Green Building Rating System, developed by the [[U.S. Green Building Council]]) involve evolving check lists that reduce the impact of new buildings on the environment, while improving environmental [[sustainability]]. [[Sustainable architecture]], [[sustainable design]], and [[natural building]] all  embrace similar goals and solution concepts. The computer models used to evaluate green building design do not include the [[thermal science]] and architectural [[design pattern]]s necessary to evaluate [[state-of-the-art]] [[passive solar building design]] or zero energy design.  One green building limitation is that the potentially-complex [[thermal physics]] necessary for zero energy design is not part of the required formal education for professional architects{{Fact|date=May 2008}}. Thus, the knowledge of zero energy design is less common than the basics of [[green building]]{{Fact|date=May 2008}}.  ==Zero-energy buildings worldwide== ===Germany=== Technische Universität Darmstadt won first place in the international zero energy design 2007 Solar Decathlon competition, scoring highest in the Architecture, Lighting, and Engineering contests &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solardecathlon.org/scores_standings.html#first DOE Solar Decathlon: Final Results:First Place: Technische Universität Darmstadt]&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Self-Sufficient Solar House &quot; Fraunhofer Institute's (ZEB), Freiburg, Germany &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ise.fhg.de/publications/brochures-and-procuct-information/buildings-and-technical-building-components/the-solar-house-in-freiburg/at_download/file 00e_ISE-Brochure_The_Solar_House.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  ===Canada=== In [[Canada]] the Net-Zero Energy Home Coalition &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netzeroenergyhome.ca/ Net-Zero Energy Home (NZEH) Coalition]&lt;/ref&gt; is an industry association promoting net-zero energy home construction and the adoption of a near net-zero energy home (nNZEH), NZEH Ready and NZEH standard.

The idea of a road being built across all of Central America became a tangible goal in [[1932]] as the [[United States]] began conducting aerial surveys using the [[United States Army|U.S. Army’s]] new photo reconnaissance and photographic aerial mapping technology.  However, the aerial mapping effort was not directly tied to the upcoming Inter-American Highway project and was conducted with the cooperation of several of the Central American republics.  By [[1940]], the U.S. had a strong presence in Central America, especially in Panama.  The U.S. owned and operated both the [[Panama Canal]] and the [[Panama Railroad]], but with the looming war in [[Europe]], the U.S. felt it necessary to establish a more direct connection with Panama.  Therefore, the U.S. and Panamanian governments agreed to begin the construction of a trans-isthmus highway located outside of the Canal Zone.  Thus, the construction of the actual Inter-American Highway was instigated by the U.S. as a safety precaution at the beginning of [[World War II]].    Like with the Panama Canal project, the principle engineers and administrators of the highway construction were supplied by the United States.  Working and living conditions varied depending on the location and season, but they were described by the [[North America]]n crew as &quot;primitive&quot; and they recall their experiences as both &quot;hilarious and tragic&quot; {{Fact|date=February 2007}}.  For those stationed in larger cities, their families were allowed to come and stay with them as an incentive to keep them from returning to the U.S.  Many pieces of what is now the Inter-American Highway were constructed independently by individual countries prior to 1940.  However, these roads only existed between large cities and were not in very good condition.  Unlike in the United States, transportation in Central America had progressed rapidly from ox-cart paths to air transport creating numerous gaps in the ground transportation network.  One of the greatest challenges faced by the workers was in bridging in these gaps. But the gaps were indeed bridged.  Progress on the IAH was painstakingly slow due to the isolation of the building sites and frequent natural obstacles such as mountains and rivers.  Nonetheless, construction on the IAH was hastened as the threat of the [[Germany|German]] [[U-boats]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] increased.  As part of the U.S. war effort, the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] began the construction of a &quot;Military Road&quot; in conjunction with the IAH.  This group of engineers was allowed access to all the Central American nations involved in the original highway project due to the war emergency status of the Military Road.    The construction of both the IAH and the auxiliary military road progressed at a breakneck speed, and construction supplies quickly ran out.  The scarcity of construction material only served to augment local unease concerning project since local merchants had no precedence over imported materials from the U.S. or shipping rights, and therefore made little profit from the whole affair.  Although construction did not directly benefit local business, it did provide employment of many of the local people.  However, this positive impact only lasted as long as the construction team was in an area.  For example, after the German submarine threat subsided (due to the presence of the U.S. Navy) the Army Corps ceased construction on the Military Road project, suddenly leaving many people unemployed and upset.    After the Army engineers left Central America, IAH construction started back up at full steam, having inherited a significant amount of supplies and equipment from the abandoned project.  By [[1946]], the IAH was ready for inspection by U.S. diplomats and engineers, but was far from being finished.  Most of the road was only passable by [[Jeep]], but the basic road outline had been carved out of the surrounding jungle and mountains.  The road was finally finished in [[1967]] and existed as a continuous strip of gravel, dirt, or asphalt between Panama and Mexico.  The only section of the IAH that was constructed without any form of U.S. aid was the 1,600 mile Mexican strip between Nuevo Laredo and the [[Guatemala]]n border.  ==External links== *http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/blazer009a.htm  ==References== {{reflist}}  [[Category:Pan-American Highway]] [[Category:Highways in Laredo, Texas]]  [[cs:Interamericana]] [[vi:Đường cao tốc Liên Mỹ]]</text>     </revision>

In addition, it is the only species of sucker to inhabit [[Asia]], specifically the rivers of eastern [[Siberia]].  The body of the longnose sucker is long and round with dark olive or grey sides and top and a light underside.  They are typically 15 - 25 inches long and weigh between one and two lb.  The longnose sucker is a bottom-feeding fish, eating [[aquatic plants]], [[algae]], and small [[invertebrates]].  They are preyed upon by larger predatory fish, such as [[bass (fish)|bass]], [[walleye]], [[trout]], [[northern pike]], [[muskellunge]], and [[burbot]].  They are fished for game and food and also used as bait to catch the larger predators.  Longnose suckers are often confused with [[white suckers]], as they appear very similar.  ==References== * {{ITIS|ID=163894|taxon=Catostomus catostomus|year=2006|date=30 January}} * {{FishBase_species|genus=Catostomus|species=catostomus|year=2005|month=10}}  ==External links== * [http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10364_18958-45693--,00.html Michigan DNR species info] * [http://www.rook.org/earl/bwca/nature/fish/catostomuscat.html Species profile by Earl J.S.

''Gangbusters'' is a game about [[crime]] in the [[United States]] during the 1920s and 1930s.  Players take the roles of criminals, law enforcement professionals, or other characters (such as newspaper [[reporters]]) who investigate or oppose criminals.  An emphasis is placed on the violent growth of [[organized crime]] during [[Prohibition]]. [[Political corruption]] is also a recurring theme.  ==Setting== ''Gangbusters'' was inspired by both historical figures (such as [[Al Capone]]) and fictional accounts of the era.  [[Films]] were an especially strong influence; the game's bibliography lists dozens of movies for inspiration, ranging from [[The Big House (film)|''The Big House'']] to [[The Untouchables (1987 film)|''The Untouchables'']].  The default location for ''Gangbusters'' campaigns is '''Lakefront City''', a fictional metropolis located (in an unspecified [[U.S. state|state]]) on the western shore of [[Lake Michigan]].  A basic description of the city is included in the ''Gangbusters'' rules, and expanded upon in the five  [[Adventure (role-playing games)|adventures]] published for the game.  ==System== Character generation in ''Gangbusters'' follows a pattern common in role-playing games of the early 1980s -- a player randomly generates his character's [[Attribute (role-playing games)|abilities]] (such as Muscle and Luck) using [[dice]], then chooses a career ([[character class]]) for the character.  Careers for [[player characters]] are limited to Criminal, FBI Agent, Newspaper Reporter, Police Officer, Private Investigator, and Prohibition Agent.  Each career includes a unique set of advantages and disadvantages to differentiate it from the others.  Characters are further customized by adding non-career [[Skill (role-playing games)|skills]], such as Auto Theft or Photography.  Characters are improved by earning [[experience points]].  Experience points are awarded (by the [[gamemaster]], called the '''Judge''' in ''Gangbusters'') based on a character's success in his career.  For example, criminals earn experience points based on how profitable their crimes are, while police officers earn experience points for capturing criminals.  Earning experience points increases a character's level (which is an indicator of social status in the game setting), and allows the character's player to improve the character's abilities and purchase new skills.  ''Gangbusters'' uses a percentile-based [[Game mechanic|mechanic]] for most task resolutions.  The basic chances of a character succeeding at an action are equal to the character's score in a relevant ability or skill, subject to modifiers assigned by the Judge.  The player of that character then rolls [[percentile dice]] to determine if the character succeeded.  The results of actions (such as the damage caused by weapons or the amount of money produced by a criminal enterprise) may be determined by further dice rolls.  All dice rolls in the game use [[ten-sided dice]].  ==History==  The first edition of ''Gangbusters'' (ISBN 978-0-394-52597-6), published in 1982, used the boxed game format typical for [[TSR, Inc.|TSR Hobbies]] games in the 1980s.  In addition to the 64-page rule book, the box contained a 16-page adventure, a game map (representing several blocks of Lakefront City), a sheet of cardboard counters (representing characters and vehicles), and two dice. (Rolston 1983)  Between 1982 and 1984, TSR published five adventure modules for ''Gangbusters''.  In order, they were:  * ''Trouble Brewing'' by Tom Moldvay (ISBN 978-0-935696-84-4) * ''Murder in Harmony'' by Mark Acres (ISBN 978-0-935696-85-1) * ''Death on the Docks'' by Mark Acres (ISBN 978-0-88038-013-3)  * ''The Vanishing Investigator'' by [[Tracy Hickman]] (ISBN 978-0-88038-045-4) * ''Death in Spades'' by Tracy Hickman (ISBN 978-0-39454-014-6)  Three packs of ''Gangbusters'' [[Miniature figure|miniatures]] were also produced by TSR. [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tpope/sol/tsr/gangbusters.html]  In 1990, TSR, Inc. released a second edition of the ''Gangbusters'' rules, but mislabeled it as a &quot;New 3rd Edition&quot; (ISBN 978-0-88038-975-4). [http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=117866] The 3rd Edition (as it came to be known) is a 128-page softcover book combining the text of the first edition rule book with information taken from the adventures ''Trouble Brewing'' and ''Murder in Harmony''.  Except for minor edits, the 3rd Edition ''Gangbusters'' game mechanics are indistinguishable from those of the original edition.  ==References== * Pope, Thomas.

The [[Miami Heat]] won the championship in 6 games over the [[Dallas Mavericks]], winning the final game at the [[American Airlines Center]] in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], and becoming the third team to win a championship after trailing 0&amp;ndash;2 in the series. This was Dallas' and Miami's first appearance in the finals. Heat guard [[Dwyane Wade]] was named [[NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] of the series. It is considered to be the most controversial NBA Finals due to the fact that Dwyane Wade shot more free-throws than the entire Dallas Mavericks team in the last two games of the series.  ==Format== The Finals were played using a 2-3-2 site format, where the first two and last two games are held at the team with [[home court advantage]]. The NBA, after experimenting in the early years, restored this original format for the Finals in 1985. As of yet, the other playoff series are still running on a 2-2-1-1-1 site format.  The [[Playoff format#Best-of-Seven Playoff|best-of-seven series]] began on [[June 8]], [[2006]], with the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] champion Heat (the second-seeded team in the East) playing the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] champion Mavericks (the fourth-seeded team in the West). Because the Dallas Mavericks had a better regular season win-loss record, they had [[home team|home court advantage]].  The series was somewhat unusual in that it featured two teams who had never been to the [[NBA Finals]] before. The last time that had happened was 35 seasons prior, when the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], led by [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], beat the [[Washington Wizards|Baltimore Bullets]] 4&amp;ndash;0 in the [[1971 NBA Finals]].  ==Qualifying==  {{main|2006 NBA Playoffs}} * The Miami Heat won the 2006 Eastern Conference Finals over the [[Detroit Pistons]], 4&amp;ndash;2. * The Dallas Mavericks won the 2006 Western Conference Finals over the [[Phoenix Suns]], 4&amp;ndash;2.  ==Broadcast notes==  [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] had exclusive rights to televise the NBA Finals in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;nba.com, [http://www.nba.com/news/schedule_050808.html NBA Announces 2005-06 Game And Television Schedule], accessed [[May 5]], [[2007]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Play-by-play]] announcer [[Mike Breen]] and [[color commentator]] [[Hubie Brown]] called the action, with courtside reporting by [[Lisa Salters]] and [[Stuart Scott]].

The momentum-changing comeback was capped by a [[Gary Payton]] field goal from just inside the three-point line with 9.3 seconds left.  [[Dirk Nowitzki]] had a chance to tie the game at the free throw line with 3.4 seconds to go, but missed 1 of 2, sealing the win for Miami.  {{basketballbox   | bg = #eee   | date = June 13   | report = [http://www.nba.com/games/20060613/DALMIA/recap.html 3]   | time = 9:00pm ET   | team1 = [[Dallas Mavericks]]   | score1 = 96   | score2 = 98'''   | team2 = '''[[Miami Heat]]   | Q1 = 21-29   | Q2 = 22-23   | Q3 = 34-16   | Q4 = 19-30   | points1 = [[Dirk Nowitzki]] 30   | rebounds1 = [[Erick Dampier]] 9   | assist1 = [[Jason Terry]] 5   | points2 = [[Dwyane Wade]] 42   | rebounds2 = [[Dwyane Wade]] 13   | assist2 = [[Shaquille O'Neal]] 5   | place = [[AmericanAirlines Arena]], [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]   | attendance = 20,145   | referee =  [[Dan Crawford]], [[Ken Mauer]], [[Jack Nies]]   | TV = [[NBA on ABC|ABC]]   | series = Dallas leads series, 2-1. }}  ===Game Four=== Dwyane Wade shined again for the Heat with 36 points, and Miami held Dallas to just seven points in the fourth quarter en route to a series-tying, blowout victory. The Mavericks' low-scoring fourth quarter was the lowest ever by any team during the NBA Finals. [[Jerry Stackhouse]] caught [[Shaquille O'Neal]] with a flagrant foul that resulted in him being suspended for Game 5. Mavericks officials called the suspension of Stackhouse, who was a key player, unfair. Shaq later publicly said that the Stackhouse foul was less vicious than a love tap from his daughters.   {{basketballbox   | bg = #eee   | date = June 15   | report = [http://www.nba.com/games/20060615/DALMIA/recap.html 4]   | time = 9:00pm ET   | team1 = [[Dallas Mavericks]]   | score1 = 74   | score2 = 98'''   | team2 = '''[[Miami Heat]]   | Q1 = 25-30   | Q2 = 19-24   | Q3 = 23-24   | Q4 = 7-20   | points1 = [[Jason Terry]] 17   | rebounds1 = [[Dirk Nowitzki]] 9   | assist1 = [[Jerry Stackhouse]] 4   | points2 = [[Dwyane Wade]] 36   | rebounds2 = [[Shaquille O'Neal]] 13   | assist2 = [[Jason Williams]] 6   | place = [[AmericanAirlines Arena]], [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]   | attendance = 20,145   | referee =  [[Dick Bavetta]], [[Mike Callahan]], [[Bernie Fryer]]   | TV = [[NBA on ABC|ABC]]   | series = Miami ties series, 2-2. }}  ===Game Five=== Making a strong case for NBA Finals MVP, Dwyane Wade was the star yet again with 43 points shooting as many free throws as all the Mavericks combined, leading the Heat to their third straight win over Dallas after being down 0–2 in the series. After a controversial play in which Mavericks owner Mark Cuban thought Wade committed a backcourt violation, Wade hit the game-winning free throws with 1.9 seconds left, and also made the shot that sent the game into overtime. He set an NBA Finals record for most made free-throws in a game with 21. The NBA, upon further review of the play, deemed that the officials made the correct call, and that there was no backcourt violation committed.&lt;ref&gt;usatoday.com, [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/playoffs/2006-06-20-notes_x.htm No backcourt violation on winning possession, NBA says], accessed [[May 5]], [[2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;  After the game, Dirk Nowitzki kicked a ball into the stands and Mavericks owner Mark Cuban caused many &quot;acts of misconduct&quot; resulting in both of them being fined $5,000 and $250,000 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;espn.com, [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2006/news/story?id=2492729 Cuban fined $250K for actions after Game 5], accessed [[May 5]], [[2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;   {{basketballbox   | bg = #eee   | date = June 18   | report = [http://www.nba.com/games/20060618/DALMIA/recap.html 5]   | time = 9:00pm ET   | team1 = [[Dallas Mavericks]]   | score1 = 100   | score2 = 101'''&lt;small&gt; (OT)&lt;/small&gt;   | team2 = '''[[Miami Heat]]   | Q1 = 21-24   | Q2 = 30-19   | Q3 = 20-27   | Q4 = 22-23   | OT = 7-8   | points1 = [[Jason Terry]] 35   | rebounds1 = [[Josh Howard]] 10   | assist1 = [[Marquis Daniels]] 4   | points2 = [[Dwyane Wade]] 43   | rebounds2 = [[Shaquille O'Neal]] 12   | assist2 = [[Dwyane Wade|Wade]], [[Jason Williams|Williams]] 4 each   | place = [[AmericanAirlines Arena]], [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]   | attendance = 20,145   | referee =  [[Joe Crawford]], [[Joe DeRosa]], [[Bennett Salvatore]]   | TV = [[NBA on ABC|ABC]]   | series = Miami leads series, 3-2. }}  ===Game Six=== Behind Dwyane Wade's 36 points, Miami edged Dallas to win their first championship in franchise history as Jason Terry missed a critical 3-pointer that would've sent the game to overtime. Averaging 34.7 points per game in the championship series, Wade was named NBA Finals MVP (Most Valuable Player).    {{basketballbox   | bg = #eee   | date = June 20   | report = [http://www.nba.com/games/20060620/MIADAL/recap.html 6]   | time = 9:00pm ET   | team1 = '''[[Miami Heat]]   | score1 = 95'''   | score2 = 92   | team2 = [[Dallas Mavericks]]   | Q1 = 23-30   | Q2 = 26-18   | Q3 = 22-20   | Q4 = 24-24   | points2 = [[Dirk Nowitzki]] 29   | rebounds2 = [[Dirk Nowitzki]] 12   | assist2 = [[Jason Terry]] 5   | points1 = [[Dwyane Wade]] 36   | rebounds1 = [[Shaquille O'Neal]] 12   | assist1 = [[Jason Williams]] 7   | place = [[American Airlines Center]], [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]   | attendance = 20,522   | referee =  [[Dan Crawford]], [[Steve Javie]], [[Eddie F. Rush]]   | TV = [[NBA on ABC|ABC]]   | series = Miami wins series, 4–2. }}  ==Trivia==  *Dwyane Wade shattered the free throw record in a 6 game NBA Finals with 97 attempts and 75 makes. He averaged over 16 free throw attempts a game.  *The Heat became the second team to win the three middle games in a Finals series at home (2-3-2 format adopted in 1985), joining the 2004 Pistons as the only other home team to do so. *Though many will remember this as coach Pat Riley's fifth NBA Championship as a coach, he actually won one as a player and one as an assistant coach for the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in [[1980 NBA Finals|1980]], bringing his total to seven championships. He claimed he would give all his previous championships back just for this title with the Miami Heat. *Riley was so confident in his team's ability (up 3-2 in the series after having won three straight in Miami) that when asked prior to Game 6 about their would-be plan for Game 7 he told reporters at a press conference that he only packed one suit, one shirt and one tie. **Further, according to O'Neal and many other Heat players, Riley had told them on the day the Finals started [[June 8]] that they would win the NBA Championship on [[June 20]]. *All games were held in a building named after [[American Airlines]] with the [[American Airlines Center]] in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], and the [[AmericanAirlines Arena]] in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]. Because of this, the series was nicknamed by some as the American Airlines Series. *Both Dallas and Miami were [[expansion team]]s in the [[1980s]]; the Mavericks joined the league in [[1980-81 NBA season|1980]], and the Heat joined the league in [[1988-89 NBA season|1988]]. *Miami becomes the third team in NBA history to win the NBA Finals after being down 0-2 in the series. The [[1969]] [[Boston Celtics]] and the [[1977]] [[Portland Trail Blazers]] were the other two. The Celtics won games 3, 4 and 6 at home while winning game 7 in Los Angeles against the Lakers, while the Blazers won against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in games 3, 4 and 6 at home and in game 5 on the road. The Heat are the only one of the three to come back in a 2-3-2 formatted series. *The Heat are the third Miami-based professional sports team to ever win a championship. The [[Miami Dolphins]] won [[Super Bowl VII|Super Bowls VII]] and [[Super Bowl VIII|VIII]], and the [[Florida Marlins]] won the [[1997 World Series|1997]] and [[2003 World Series]]. In addition, the [[University of Miami]] have also won five National Championships in Division I college football and four NCAA [[College World Series]] NCAA Division I baseball titles. *This was the second NBA Finals in which the two teams came from Florida and Texas. Shaquille O'Neal also played for the Florida-based team in the [[1995 NBA Finals]]; his [[Orlando Magic]] were swept by the [[Houston Rockets]] that year. **These two are the Florida teams' only Finals appearances; furthermore, this is the state's first NBA Championship win. *With the Mavericks' Finals debut, all three Texas teams have made the championship round at least once.  The Rockets have four (2 wins, 2 losses), and the [[San Antonio Spurs]] have 4 (4 wins). *The Mavs were the third Texas team in the 2005-06 seasons to make the championship in a major sport joining the [[Houston Astros]] and [[Texas Longhorns football]] team. *The Heat's Antoine Walker and Derek Anderson won their second championship as teammates as the two were members of the 1996 National Champion [[University of Kentucky]] basketball team. Dallas' Keith Van Horn and Miami's Michael Doleac were also teammates at the [[University of Utah]] and from 1996 through '97, Kentucky defeated Utah in the [[1998 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1998 NCAA Championship Game]]. *Both teams won their Conference Finals by the very same total that the Heat won the NBA Championship series, 4-2. *[[Gary Payton]] and [[Alonzo Mourning]] became the second duo of former [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year|NBA Defensive Players of the Year]] to win an NBA championship together. ([[Michael Jordan]] and [[Dennis Rodman]] won three as members of the [[Chicago Bulls]] between 1996 and 1998). * The Heat were the first Eastern Conference team in 20 years to win an NBA Finals that ''was not'' either the Bulls or the Pistons. The last such team to win was the 1986 Boston Celtics. * The 2006 NBA Finals has been the only NBA Finals in the 2000s not to feature either the [[San Antonio Spurs]] or [[Los Angeles Lakers]].  ==See also== *[[National Basketball Association]] *[[2006 NBA Playoffs]] *[[NBA Finals]]  ==References== &lt;div class=&quot;references-small&quot; style=&quot;-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;&quot;&gt; &lt;references /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  ==External links== *[http://www.nba.com/finals2006/ The official site of the 2006 NBA Finals]  {{NBA Finals}} {{Miami Heat}}  [[Category:National Basketball Association Finals]] [[Category:2005-06 NBA season|Finals]] [[Category:Dallas Mavericks]] [[Category:Miami Heat]]  [[es:Finales de la NBA de 2006]] [[id:Final National Basketball Association 2006]] [[it:NBA Playoffs 2006]] [[ja:2006年のNBAファイナル]] [[zh:2006年NBA总决赛]]</text>     </revision>

It was produced by [[Fox Television Studios|Twentieth Television]] with directors David Hogan, Alex Hennech, Jim Slocum and Jeremy Stanford.    ''Fashion House'' focused on greed, lust and ambition surrounding a violent corporate takeover of the business's hottest company. It starred [[Bo Derek]] as the ruthless head of the business and [[Morgan Fairchild]] as her long-time arch-rival.  The show was known more for the leads' hair-pulling, name-calling, and vase-throwing than for its romance, passion and drama.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out.com/detail.asp?id=22384 Out.com Features | A Summer of Camp&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] has not announced plans to release this series on [[DVD]].  ==Production Notes== ''Fashion House'' aired for a 65-episode run.

While the show is set in [[Los Angeles]], it was filmed at [[Stu Segall Productions]] in San Diego.

Butler]] that detail a [[secret history]] continuing into from the [[Ancient Egyptian]] period to the far [[future history|future]], involving [[telepathic]] [[mind control]] and an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] plague. A profile of Butler in ''Black Women in America'' notes that the themes of the series include &quot;racial and gender-based animosity, the ethical implications of biological engineering, the question of what it means to be human, ethical and unethical uses of power, and how the assumption of power changes people.&quot; [http://blog.oup.com/oupblog/2006/02/octavia_butler.html#more]  Butler's first published novel, 1976's ''Patternmaster'', was the first book in this series to appear. From 1977 until 1984, she published four more ''Patternist'' novels: ''Mind of My Mind'' (1977), ''Survivor'' (1978), ''[[Wild Seed (Octavia Butler novel)|Wild Seed]]'' (1980) and ''Clay's Ark'' (1984). Until Butler began publishing the ''[[Xenogenesis]]'' trilogy in 1987, all but one of her published books  were ''Patternist'' novels. (1979's ''Kindred'' was the exception.)  Butler later expressed a dislike for the novel ''Survivor'', and declined to bring it back into print.   ==Plot summary==  Chronologically, the series starts with the fourth novel published, ''Wild Seed''. Set in the 17th and 18th centuries, the story involves the relationship between two immortals--Doro, a telepath who transfers his consciousness from one victim to another, and Anyanwu, a [[Shapeshifting|shape-shifter]] with perfect control over her body. They struggle to live together over generations as Doro attempts to create a new race through a [[selective breeding]] program.  The series' history continues with ''Mind of My Mind'', in which Doro's breeding program has created a society of networked telepaths that he struggles to control.  ''Clay's Ark'', the last book of the series to be published, deals with a colony of people who have been mutated by a disease that astronauts unwittingly brought back to Earth from outer space. The group struggles to keep itself isolated enough to keep the disease from spreading throughout humanity.  [[Survivor (Octavia Butler novel)|''Survivor'']], the book in the series that Butler later disowned, depicts the Clay's Ark disease ravaging the Earth, and Doro's telepathic descendants asserting control over what remains of humanity. One group of regular humans decides to escape Earth to a new planet, where they struggle to co-exist with the species that already lives there.  ''Patternmaster'', the first book to be published but the last in the series' internal chronology, depicts a distant future in which regular humans are dominated by the networked telepaths, who are themselves ruled by the most powerful telepath, known as the Patternmaster. The plot revolves around the aging of the current Patternmaster and the battle among other powerful telepaths to see who will become his successor. The descendants of the victims of the extraterrestrial disease, animalistic [[mutants]] known as Clayarks, make an appearance in the book.  ==References== *Salvaggio, Ruth. &quot;Octavia Butler and the Black Science Fiction Heroine.&quot; ''Black American Literature Forum,'' Vol. 18, No. 2 (Summer 1984): 78-81.

Mix 102.3 plays current hits and a variety of 70s, 80s and 90s music ([[Hot Adult Contemporary]]), primarily targeted at the 25-54 age group, the group most valued by advertisers. Adelaide's Mix 102.3 is part of the '''Mix Network''' with sister stations in other major Australian cities - [[Mix 106.5]] [[Sydney]], [[Mix 101.1]] [[Melbourne]], [[97.3 FM (Brisbane)|97.3 FM]] [[Brisbane]] and [[Mix 106.3]] [[Canberra]].  ==History:== The station known as Mix 102.3 began its life as Radio 5AD, an [[amplitude modulation|AM]] station owned by Advertiser Newspapers Ltd, publishers of the [[Adelaide Advertiser]] newspaper.   During its early years, 5AD broadcast a wide range of programs, from orchestral concerts to comedies, serials and sporting events. Some programs, such as the comedy &quot;[[Yes, What?]]&quot; were produced in Adelaide for broadcast by other network stations around [[Australia]]. Children's programs included &quot;Search for the Golden Boomerang&quot;, and the 5AD Children's club.  [[Television]] was introduced to Australia in [[1956]], bringing major changes to radio programing, signaling the end of the kind of [[block programming]] 5AD and other stations had been playing. 5AD moved to music based programming, using a number of marketing slogans: &quot;5AD, Action Radio&quot;, &quot;Power Radio 5AD, Where Your Friends Are&quot;, among others.  5AD personalities of the 1960s and 1970s included [[Bob Francis (radio)|Bob Francis]], [[Alec Macaskill]], [[Keith Conlon]], [[Barry Ion]] who also voiced the hilarious Peter Plus character, [[Tony Pilkington]], John Vincent, Bob Byrne, [[Dean Jaensch]], Jeff Sunderland, [[Kevin Crease]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, R.R. &quot;The Magic Spark - 50 Years of Australian Radio&quot;, The Hawthorn Press, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1980s 5AD was the number one radio station in Adelaide, spearheaded by the Bazz and Pilko breakfast show, rating at above 30% of the total Adelaide audience.  As a top 40 station with its slogan &quot;Rhythm of the City&quot;, 5AD was upstoppable as the clear market leader in Adelaide radio.  5AD won all dayparts, including mornings with Peter Butler, afternoons with Sam Angelsy and the popular night show for teenagers &quot;Dial a Hit&quot; hosted by Steve Mill and Di Stapleton.   In the mid 1980s, 5AD moved to an [[Easy Listening]] format, first as &quot;Easy Listening 5AD, then today's easy listening 5AD then Adelaide's Best Place to Relax&quot;.

For his unparalleled [[Missionary#Non-religious missionaries|missionary]] zeal and his love of Ukrainian culture, he is considered by many to be the &quot;Father of Ukrainian Dance&quot;.  ==Early days== Vasyl Avramenko was born on March 22, 1895 in [[Stebliv]], a [[townlet]] located on the [[Ros' River]] approximately 100 km south of [[Kiev]], in present-day [[Ukraine]] during the [[Imperial Russia|imperial reign of Russia]]. Orphaned at a young age, he was forced to wander [[Homelessness|homeless]] as an [[Adolescence|adolescent]], until he eventually headed east, crossing the vast expanse of Russia towards [[Siberia]], and reunited with his older brothers in [[Vladivostok]], on the coast of the [[Sea of Japan]]. There, Vasyl's eldest brother taught him how to read and write, which enabled Vasyl to gain employment at the [[naval base]]. This position allowed Avramenko to visit several major Asian ports as a crewman aboard [[Russian Navy|Russian naval]] [[Naval ship|vessels]]; such worldly exposure encouraged in him a greater love of learning, and he returned to study with his brother whenever possible, eventually earning the qualifications to become a [[Primary education|primary school]] teacher. It was during this time that Vasyl Avramenko saw a production of [[Ivan Kotlyarevsky|Ivan Kotliarevsky's]] [[operetta]] ''[[Natalka Poltavka]]'' in Vladivostok, which Avramenko later recounted as having been the first experience of viewing his fellow Ukrainians on stage.  Avramenko's [[Wanderlust|wandering soul]] soon encouraged him to leave Vladivostok. As he was travelling south towards China, World War I broke out and he was pressed into service for the Empire. After receiving [[Recruit training|basic training]], he was sent off to fight at the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Russian front]].   After the war, Avramenko returned to his homeland and where he was surrounded by a revived sense Ukrainian [[nationalism]], with many [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|clamoring for an independent Ukraine]]. Wanting to learn more about his [[Ukrainian culture]], in 1918 he enrolled at the [[Mykola Lysenko Institute of Music and Drama]] in Kiev. There, he would find his calling in the classroom of [[Vasyl Verkhovynets]], a [[Musicology|musicologist]] and [[Ethnology|ethnologist]] who had adapted Ukrainian folk dances for the stage. Verkhovynets' theories of Ukrainian dance, which he based on his theatrical training and his extensive research of the village dances of Central Ukraine, would inspire Avramenko to live the life of an artist: after graduating from the Institute, he began performing with [[Joseph Stadnyk]]'s performers in Stanyslaviv (present-day ''[[Ivano-Frankivsk]]''), and later joined  Verkhovynets as a member of the famed theatrical troupe of [[Mykola Sadovsky]] in the city of [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]]. During this time, Avramenko took copious notes compiling a vocabulary of Ukrainian dances and dance steps, which he would later develop into his life's work. In his book, ''Ukrainian National Dances, Music, and Costumes'', Avramenko acknowledged the work of Verkhovynets' and the Ukrainian theater in preserving and elevating the legacy of dance in Ukraine.  After a brief [[History of Ukraine#First World War, the revolutions and aftermath|period of independence]], Ukraine once again was overrun by foreign powers. Consequently, Vasyl Avramenko found himself in a [[Poland|Polish]] [[internment camp]] in 1921.  ==Early career== Demonstrating his characteristic zeal, Avramenko began his first &quot;School of [[Ukrainian Dance]] and Ballet&quot; on January 25, 1921, in a Polish internment camp near [[Kalisz]] for veterans of the defunct [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. He began with 100 students (everyone from the guards to small children), teaching them the basic steps of Ukrainian dance, eventually teaching whole dances, and finally putting on a celebrated performance on May 24 of that year.  Avramenko soon became so successful and popular that he set out on tour with a group of his students through present-day western Ukraine, often presenting demonstrations and workshops in the towns he visited, encouraging others to perform his dances and pass them on to others. The tour passed through [[Lviv]] several times between 1922 and 1924, while also visiting [[Rivne]], [[Lutsk]], [[Kremianets]], [[Oleksandriia]], [[Mezhirich]], [[Kholm]], [[Brest-Litovsk]], [[Stryi]], [[Ivano-Frankivsk|Stanyslaviv]], [[Kolomyia]], [[Przemyśl]], [[Deliatyn]], [[Ternopil]], and [[Drohobych]] in that time.   Eventually, for reasons as yet unknown, Avramenko would turn away from his Ukrainian homeland, and set out to visit Ukrainian enclaves in the rest of Poland, and further off in present-day [[Slovakia]] and the [[Czech Republic]] (at the time united as [[Czechoslovakia]]) as well as Germany, including stops in [[Podebrady]], [[Prague]], and [[Delmenhorst]]. In 1925, with the help of [[Captain John S. Atkinson]], then the director of the [[Canadian Bureau for the Advancement of Music]], Vasyl Avramenko, the patriot of the former Ukrainian People's Republic and therefore a &quot;man without a country&quot;, was nonetheless granted permission to enter Canada.  The movie ''Natalka Poltavka'', directed by Vasyl Avramenko, was released on February 14, 1937 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0029295|Natalka Poltavka (1937)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first Ukrainian language film produced in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ukrainians in the United States|last=Halich|first=Wasyl|year=1970|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=0405005520|pages=p. 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ==Spreading Ukrainian dance== Avramenko traveled from town to town, teaching the same dance to villagers. His first tours in Canada began in 1926, and ended in 1952.[http://www.brama.com/news/press/2003/12/031203ukrainiandance_projectgrant.html] When he was finished teaching in a town, he would assign a leader to continue teaching to the villagers. One of these leaders was Chester Kuc, who founded the Cheremosh Ukrainian dance ensemble.[http://www.cheremosh.ca/histchem.html] He taught these dances in North America, as well as in South America and Australia. During his lifetime, he created many Ukrainian dance studios, including one in [[New York]] where he lived until his death in 1981. He staged performances across Canada and USA, including the [[Century of Progress|Chicago World's Fair]] of 1933 and a performance at the [[White House]]. He also produced numerous [[Ukrainian language]] films.[http://www.ihrc.umn.edu/research/vitrage/all/am/ihrc265.html]  ==References== &lt;references /&gt; '''In English''' *Nahachewsky, Andriy. &quot;Avramenko and the Paradigm of National Culture&quot; in ''Journal of Ukrainian Studies 28, No.2 (Winter 2003)''.

[[England]] had a successful hold on [[North America]] and various other areas, including [[India]], [[Spain]] had a large hold of [[South America]] and [[North America]], and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] had successful outposts in [[India]]. The [[France|French]] were beginning to colonize parts of North America, but where not permanent settlements like the Spanish and British colonies.   In [[1628]], [[Quebec]] became controlled by the [[Company of One Hundred Associates]], a merchant-run join-stock enterprise founded by [[Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu|Cardinal Richelieu]]. The Company received a monopoly over fur trade, and title to all the lands in New France, in trade for 4,000 settlers to the new colony, as well as supplies and priests. Like all other colonies, French influence in the New World led to problems with the natives: war for control of the fur trade and French disease killed off large portions of Indian tribes.  France not only had colonies North America, but also controlled the French West Indies, in the Caribbean Sea. During the 1600s, France colonized several of the [[West India]]n Islands because of competition with the Spanish, English, and Dutch. Despite controlling very many of the West Indian Islands, only Martinique, Guadeloupe, and some nearby small islands survived as the French West Indies.  Quite surprisingly, the idea of mercantilism was first described by the French finance minister, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]]. Colbert's idea was a &quot;favorable balance of trade&quot; in which goods were exported for gold, versus an &quot;unfavorable balance of trade&quot; in which gold would flow out of the country. Colbert also intended to get rid of internal tariffs, and to tax the nobility, but failed.  [[Category:Colonialism]]</text>     </revision>

Eventually, Hercules leads her to a camp of refugees from the city, which has been taken over by [[Hera]]'s Blue Monks. Hercules helps the refugees take back the city.  ==Plot synopsis==  Three men are running along the riverside, one of them stops to take a drink from the river. As he stoops down to quench his thirst a female figure composed of water rises out of the river and pulls him under, drowning him, the other two men run on. While running, one man is hit by a boulder and killed. The remaining man escapes. Elsewhere a young woman is collecting water, when the ground begins to shake. She flees back to the village to warn them that a [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] is coming. The giant follows the woman to the village and rips the roof of the [[tavern]]. Hercules presents himself to the giant and the giant challenges Hercules to a fight. Hercules goes outside and he beats the giant. As the village celebrates the defeat the man from earlier in the film arrives in the village, he asks for Hercules' help. He explains to Hercules that his people have been driven from their city, the lost city of Troy.  [[Zeus]] appears and Hercules asks him if he will help him. He asks his father how to find Troy and he says that Hera vanished it and to find it Hercules must find the one true [[compass]] which will point the way to Troy. Hercules heads off to find the compass, he find a tribe of men preparing to [[sacrifice]] a young [[virginity|virgin]] to their water god. Hercules saves her from being sacrificed, while unknowingly being watched by a mysterious robed figure. The woman tells Hercules that her name is [[Deianira|Deianeira]]. Later in the evening as they camp for the night, Deianaira tells her a story that she is the daughter of a King. She sees the dark figure and asks who he is and why she is being followed, but the figure does not answer. Later Hercules and Deianaira arrive at the slave market looking for Queen [[Omphale]], the last person to have possessed the compass. In order to get to see the Queen, Hercules sells himself as a slave, and the Queen buys him. After spending the night with the Queen Hercules gets the compass and he and Deianaira continue searching for Troy. Deianaira gets attacked by some men but the figure in the dark robe saves her and tells her to follow her destiny.  Hercules and Deianaira head on to Troy, they arrive at the ocean and the figure standing on the cliffs summons a [[sea serpent]] to do Hera's bidding. It swallows Hercules and Deianeira. Hercules kills the monster from inside and they are washed up on the shore. Deianeira sees Troy in the distance and tells Hercules that she now remembers and this is where she is from. Deianeira and Hercules get caught in a trap and taken to the king. The king is ill and he and his daughter are reunited. He tells her that the Cult of the Blue Priests have taken over the city and the people have taken refuge in the woods, he tells Deianaira to rule them well, and then dies.  Hercules tutors the people of Troy and prepares them to battle to take back Troy. Deianeira realises that the people can not beat the Cult of the Blue Priests and goes looking for the Blue Priest. The people notice that Deianaira is missing and Hercules and the people use an underground tunnel to get into the city. As the people fight the cult members Hercules goes looking for Deianaira, he finds her about to be sacrificed to Hera and saves her. The Blue Priest and Hercules fight and Hercules cuts off the Priest's head. A huge storm approaches, and Zeus tells Hercules that Hera is coming for Deianaira, Hercules saves her and Hera takes Hercules instead. As Deianaira is crowned Queen of Troy we see Hercules thrown down from out of the sky, a man approaches him asking him for help, Hercules agrees and the two men walk off to the next adventure.  ==Rating information==  *First Airing: Unknown *Second Airing: 5.8  ==Guest roles==  *Waylin ([[Robert Trebor]]) was originally intended to become a recurring character in the television series, but the producers felt that the character runs its course in the movie and had limited potential after, so the character of money-making Salmoneus was created for Trebor instead.  *This is [[Reneé O'Connor]]'s first appearance in the shared Hercules-Xena universe *Elizabeth Hawthorne who played Queen Omphale went on to play Hercules' mother in the TV series. *[[Nathaniel Lees]] went on to have numerous different roles in ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]'', ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' and ''[[Young Hercules]]''.  ==Main cast==  *[[Kevin Sorbo]] as [[Hercules]] *[[Renée O'Connor]] as [[Deianira|Deianeira]] *[[Anthony Quinn]] as [[Zeus]]  ==External links==  *{{Tv.com episode|id=110630|title=Hercules and the Lost Kingdom}}  {{xenaverse}} {{Renaissance Pictures}} [[Category:Hercules: The Legendary Journeys episodes]]  [[pt:Hercules: The Legendary Journeys - Hercules and the Lost Kingdom]] [[simple:Hercules and the Lost Kingdom]]</text>     </revision>

Street skating, as it is most commonly known among skaters, may include skate tricks such as [[ollie (skateboarding trick)|ollie]]s, or ollie variations, but often it is simply the act of [[skateboarding]] on the pavement itself.  Whatever the case may be, the act of street skating requires the rider to utilize objects which are found in urbanized settings, such as curbs, ledges, handrails, stairs, and other obstacles.  ==The origins of modern street skateboarding: the early 1980s==  Historically speaking, street skateboarding has existed since the very inception of the sport itself. For example, in the 1970s, skaters would ride skateboards through city streets to transport themselves to popular surf spots. By the mid 1970s, skateboarders in [[Southern California]] were actively seeking out street spots at local public schools. Nevertheless, the origins of true street skateboarding were not to come until the early 1980s{{Fact|date=July 2008}}. At this point in time, the [[skateboarding industry]] was experiencing a major [[recession]], which forced the closure of the majority of the [[skatepark]]s that were constructed throughout the United States in the late 1970s. The closures meant that the remaining hardcore skaters would be forced to either construct their own back yard ramps (such as [[half-pipes]]), or find somewhere else to skate altogether.  ==The golden age of street skateboarding: mid 1980s==  In the early 1980s, skateboarding was dead{{Fact|date=July 2008}}. At this time, the title 'professional skateboarder' was little more than a formality, and no pro could make a living through the sport alone{{Fact|date=July 2008}}. Not surprisingly, all contests, demonstrations, videos, and companies were [[underground culture|underground]], and far from [[mainstream]]. [[Vert (sport)|Vertical Skateboarding]] (aka, 'vert') dominated the professional scene and the magazines that covered it. However, it was at this time that upstarts such as [[Mark Gonzales]] (also known as 'the Gonz'), [[Natas Kaupas]], and other top skaters in and around Los Angeles began to get creative with variations of vert and freestyle tricks on public terrain. The first &quot;streetstyle&quot; contest was held at [[San Francisco]]'s [[Golden Gate Park]] in 1983, and [[Tommy Guerrero]] won an upset victory as an unsponsored amateur. Guerrero, from San Francisco, also got the first, true, street skating part in a video, in 1985's &quot;[[Future Primitive]]&quot; by [[Powell Peralta]]. This video part coincided with a boom in skateboarding's popularity, and was a defining moment in influencing a new generation to street skate.  ===Street skateboarding in magazines===  Magazines throughout the 1970s and early 1980s were dominated by [[vert skating]] and to a lesser extent [[freestyle skateboarding]]. 1984 is seen as something of a watershed in street skateboarding's history as [[Tommy Guerrero]] made the July cover, [[Natas Kaupas]] made the September, and [[Mark Gonzales]] made the November cover of Thrasher magazine. This level of exposure was unprecedented for street skating and marks the birth of the golden age of street skating.  ===The impact of a new medium - videocassettes===  Just as VCR's were being purchased as the latest luxury item, the skateboard video revolution began in late 1984 with the release of Powell Peralta's &quot;[[Bones Brigade Video Show]]&quot;. In it, street skating serves as just the backdrop of the videos various vert and freestyle parts as [[Lance Mountain]] cruises around Los Angeles, doing little more than bonelesses and acid drops, but the video itself helped skateboarding make a comeback. By 1985, both street skating and skateboarding's popularity was making an insurgence{{Fact|date=July 2008}}. Overnight, street skating eclipsed freestyle in popularity, though vert remained the preeminent form that got most of the attention. Photos of street skaters like Mark Gonzales, Natas Kaupas and [[Johnee Kop]] were seen fairly often, but this emerging form of skating was still not taken seriously by most and considered a fad. Up through 1987, most street skaters did mostly handplant and kicker ramp tricks. Just one year later the dynamic began shifting dramatically. The release of Powell Peralta's &quot;Public Domain&quot; and H Street's &quot;[[Shackle Me Not]]&quot; videos were an eye-opener for the skateboard world. In them a new generation of street skaters lead by [[Mike Vallely]], [[Ray Barbee]], and Matt Hensley departed from the handplant and jump ramp trends to progress street skating to a respectable level with major ollies, handrail boardslides and freestyle flip maneuvers. This was the point of no return where street skating began to progress at an extraordinary pace through the early 1990s, while vert's popularity waned rapidly.  ==Street skateboarding takes over: the early 1990s==  During the early 1990s, vertical skating nearly disappeared, and street skating was the dominant style practiced by successful professional riders{{Fact|date=July 2008}}. The mainstream popularity of skateboarding began to decline once again during the early 1990s.  By 1993, the sports popularity was at an all time low point. But during this period, hardcore skaters continued to practice in any way they could, just as they had following the skatepark crash of the late 1970s. A strong foundation for street skating had been established from the mid to late 1980s, to the point where dozens of pros were known almost exclusively for their performance on the streets. Now, it was possible for pros to build upon that foundation, and take skateboarding to new levels.  Young street professionals such as [[Frankie Hill]] and [[Ed Templeton]] had borrowed from freestyle, but also continued to push the limits of handrail skating. [[Plan B Skateboards|Plan B]]'s 1992 production, [[The Questionable Video]] features some of the best skaters of the era, including a young [[Pat Duffy]], who was then known as a &quot;handrail destroyer&quot;{{Fact|date=July 2008}}.  ===Little flips and small wheels===  Street skateboarding in the early 1990s looked nothing like that which was performed even a few years earlier in the late 1980s. Riders now rode both in normal and switch stance and would perform flip tricks and ollie variations that were mostly invented in the 1980s by world champion freestyler [[Rodney Mullen]]. Mullen himself became a street skater during this period, due to the death of freestyle. Most of the tricks that were once street staples such as the streetplant and boneless as well as any trick that involved picking a board up from the ground, were now considered cliché. Grace and speed were not encouraged in street skating at this time, and it was not uncommon for a rider to stumble off his board momentarily after landing an extremely technical flip trick. Another peculiarity of street skating in the early 1990s were the tiny wheels that were preferred as a light weight solution for flip tricks from 1991 to 1994. Such wheels were often smaller than 45 millimetres, some of which at their lowest point in 1993 were reduced to a tiny, nearly compression bearing size of just 38 millimetres.  ==Street skateboarding goes mainstream: 1995-2001== {{Unreferenced|date=October 2006}}  The skateboarding industry experienced major growth starting in the mid 1990s, and many factors are to thank for this.  The global recession that had affected so many during the decade's early years was coming to an end, which generally meant more disposable income for young people {{Fact|date=February 2007}}. As a result, more time and money could be invested into adolescent pastimes.  A new skateboarding-related culture started to form. Pop punk bands such as [[The Offspring]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[NOFX]], and [[Green Day]] began to sell millions of records in 1994, and this introduced many people to the &quot;alternative&quot; lifestyle, which included skateboarding {{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Although the mainstream has brought in money, many skateboarders feel that the mainstream has tainted skateboarding as a whole {{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Wanting to 'cash in' on a wealthy demographic, ESPN introduced the Extreme Games (later renamed the [[X-Games]]) in the summer of 1995.  The games showcased activities such as [[rollerblading]], [[Freestyle BMX|BMX biking]], [[motocross]] and other events, including skateboarding.  While skateboarding was a major part of the X-Games showcase, most skaters featured during the first few years of the competition were oriented to ramps that are commonly found in skateparks.  Accordingly, the major role that the X-Games played was turning the mainstream population onto the sport itself, at which point potential riders would be much more likely to be influenced by industry sources (such as [[Transworld Skateboarding Magazine]], or [[Thrasher magazine|Thrasher]]), that were still focusing on the street scene.  ===Influential videos===  Like no other time before it, the period between the mid 1990s and the early 21st century saw an incredible amount of influence originating in promotional videos released directly by skate companies themselves.  Whereas skate demos and competitions continued to maintain their important role that had been established in previous skate eras, hardcore skaters now focused the majority of their attention on videos, and the tricks being performed in those videos.  Skate videos in the mid 1990s were almost exclusively street based, with absolutely no freestyle, and very little vert to mention.  Some videos, such as [[Girl Skateboards]]' Mouse (1996), and [[World Industries]]' [[Rodney Mullen vs. Daewon Song]] (1997) followed the tradition of [[technical flatground skateboarding]] that had been spawned from the ashes of freestyle in the early 1990s.  Others, such as [[Toy Machine]]'s [[Welcome to Hell (video)|Welcome to Hell]] (1996), and [[Zero Skateboards]]'s [[Thrill of it All]] (1996), represented the direction that street skating  took in the late 1990s &amp;mdash; handrail skating and other types of skating such as ledges and flat bars.  ===Stairs and Rails===  Handrail skating originated in [[California]] in the spring of 1986{{Fact|date=July 2008}} and was pushed prominently into the limelight in the early 90s by Pat Duffy and his part in the Plan B &quot;Questionable Video&quot;. Although it is generally accepted that Mark Gonzales is the first to skate a handrail, it's also acknowledged that Natas Kaupas skated a handrail at this time too. Johnee Kop was the first to have a published handrail photo. Also, [[Julian Stranger]] was the first to do a frontside boardslide and have a published photo. Handrail skating continued to come into its own for the rest of the '80s, from more veteran pros like Chris Miller and [[Steve Caballero]] to then upstarts [[Andy Howell]], [[Ed Templeton]], and [[Frankie Hill]]. By 1990, the first kickflip boardslide on a handrail was performed. Handrail skating became much more common throughout the 1990s, and by 1995 [[kickflip]] and [[shove-it]] variations were being 'thrown down' on a regular basis by advanced pros like Heath Kirchart. Handrail skating became so common in the mid-1990s that 1995 was actually declared the year of the [[50-50 grind]] by [[Transworld Skateboarding Magazine]] due to the number of grinds that were being performed on rails at this time.  ===Handrail domination===  In the late 1990s and early 21st century, grinding became a major professional standard in street skating.  Not only were rails a staple in pro street skating, but also in competitions and demonstrations.  Indeed, for some time it seemed the larger the rail, and the bigger the stair set, the better.  In the last few years, grinding has remained an important part of professional street skating, but is not as essential to a video part as it once was.  ==Street skateboarding today: 2001-Present==  The skateboarding industry has now grown and flourished for nearly ten years without experiencing a major recession like those seen by previous skate generations (although minor financial losses were reported by several companies in the year 2003){{Fact|date=July 2008}}. During the last 5 years, skateboarding has taken many interesting turns. Pool skateboarding was revived on a grand scale in the years between 2000 and 2003, and continues to be featured in a number of newly released skate videos, such as [[DVS Shoes]]' [[Skate More]].  Skateparks, which were a scarce commodity in the mid 1990s, are now present in both small and large communities throughout [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. Moreover, a significant number of female participants can be reported in a sport that has been largely male dominated throughout the course of its history. Not unlike the sport itself, street skateboarding is taking a new shape, and a new direction. While handrails and stairs are still major features in skate videos, it is now obvious that other approaches are being taken by pros and amateur's alike. [[Ali Boulala]]'s short part in Flip's 2002 video [[Sorry (2002 film)|Sorry!]] was interpreted by some as an 'anti handrail manifesto' {{Fact|date=February 2007}}, because the majority of his tricks were performed on banks, down stairs, and on ledges. Recently, a number of professional street skaters have been seen performing old-school tricks (such as wallrides, bonelesses, no-complys and airwalks) in line with 1990s style flip tricks {{Fact|date=February 2007}}, i.e. Jason Adams' part in [[Black Label]]'s 2003 video Black Out.  Recently, professional skateboarders have taken to skating different obstacles than in the late 90's/early 2000s{{Fact|date=July 2008}}. Whereas in the 1990s most street skating was done on traditional ledges, rails, stairs, and gaps, now skateboarders have been skating more unusual terrain. Random banks and oddly shaped structures have become the canvas for street skaters to perform their art. [[Daewon Song]]'s skating in Skate More has been described as his masterpiece{{Fact|date=July 2008}}, and is not inclusive of handrails of any kind, as he has never been a handrail skater, and is a sharp turn from doing very technical skating (as is seen in his part in the video &quot;[[Almost: Round 3]]&quot;), to skating a more creative type of terrain. In his part, Daewon skates everything from basic benches to rock formations, waterfalls, and pools.    {{Skateboarding}}  [[Category:Skateboarding]]</text>     </revision>

Collectively they are an unarmed response to a close range pistol, such as in a [[Mugging]] situation.  The basics of the art are the appraisal of the situation, getting out of the way, and disarming or neutralizing the attacker. Even with the mastery of this art it is often much safer to comply with any person that is pointing a gun at you.  Tanju(or Tankut, Tanrıkut; meaning ''blessed by God'' in old Turkish) is also a male name in Turkish. It was used by Chinese as a reference to Turkic khans.

Lumezzane|Lumezzane]] in early years.  ;Hellas Verona In 1998, Brocchi was sold to [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Hellas Verona]] in [[Serie B]]. Brocchi followed the club promoted to Serie A.  ;Internazionale After a year in the top-division, [[Internazionale Milano F.C.|Internazionale]] signed him in 2000.  ===Milan=== In the summer of 2001, A.C. Milan re-signed him in exchange of [[Andrés Guglielminpietro]], who went to Inter. In AC Milan, Brocchi had to compete with the likes of [[Fernando Redondo]], [[Gennaro Gattuso]], [[Andrea Pirlo]] and [[Clarence Seedorf]]. He never made more than 15 appearances a year, and those were oftentimes as a substitute. His contact was renewed by the club in September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/news/kind=1/newsid=108320.html|title=Brocchi extends Milan stay|date=2003-09-19|accessdate=2008-05-27|publisher=UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ;Fiorentina Brocchi was loaned to [[ACF Fiorentina]] in July 2005, with a view to a permanent deal at the end of the season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=310524.html|title=Brocchi bound for Fiorentina|date=2005-06-19|accessdate=2008-05-27|publisher=UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but at the end of  2005-06, he returned to A.C. Milan, partly as a result of the problems Milan faced in finding new recruits due to the [[2006 Italian football scandal]].  ;Third Spell in Milan Brocchi made a career high 29 Serie A appearances in the 2006-07 season. Although [[Emerson Ferreira da Rosa|Emerson]] arrived in the 2007-08, Brocchi continued to appear regularly making 24 appearances, 10 as starter, effectively becoming [[Carlo Ancelotti]]'s first choice replacement in midfield.  ;Lazio [[A.C. Milan]] and [[S.S. Lazio]] reached an agreement for a permanent transfer on 28th August, 2008. He was sold to Lazio in a three year deal with a transfer fee of €2.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/aug28u.html|title=Brocchi Signs For Lazio|date=2008-08-28|accessdate=2008-08-28|publisher=Channel4.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ===International career=== He made his international debut for the [[Italy national football team]] in a friendly against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] on [[15 November]] [[2006]].  ==Personal life== Brocchi has other interests outside of football, he opened a cafe in Milan along with AC Milan teammate [[Christian Abbiati]], and started his own clothing brand (Baci &amp; Abbracci) with close friend and footballer [[Christian Vieri]] and model [[Alena Šeredova]].

The call letters were '''K07UU''' before becoming KFXF and upgrading to full-power status in [[1995]].   In addition to Fox, the station also ran [[UPN]] programs from [[2000]] to [[2006]], when that network merged with [[the WB]] to form [[The CW Television Network|The CW]], which is shown on a digital subchannel of ABC affiliate [[KATN]]. KFXF originally thought about becoming a secondary affiliate to Fox's sister network [[My Network TV]], but passed on it.  For a few months in [[1996]] until launching sister station [[K13XD]], KFXF carried a handful of [[CBS]] shows such as ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' and ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' after KTVF relinquished their longtime affiliation with the network for [[NBC]] on [[April 1]] that year. In its early years, KFXF ran programming from Canadian music channel [[Much Music]] during the overnight hours and for a time in 1993-94 carried the ''[[NBA on NBC]]''.  Channel 7 was originally going to be '''KSEV-TV''' in [[1984]]; it was not known whether it would be an independent or network station. It wouldn't be until another eight years when the station would finally get off the ground thanks to founder/owner Bill St. Pierre and a group of investors who formed Tanana Valley Television.  In recent months, thanks to Fox's ''[[American Idol]]'' and ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', KFXF has been catching up to KTVF and KATN in the [[Nielsen]] ratings.  KFXF and K13XD are both owned by Tanana Valley Television.

It usually takes place during the first weekend of August, maximizing the number of student participants. In this two-night and three-day convention, a wide range of activities take place. Youth from each participating city have their own [[soccer]], [[basketball]], and [[volleyball]] teams, and have friendly competitions with the youth from the other [[parishes]]. The teams are named after either the city in which the church is located, or the saint(s) whom the church is named after. Other activities in OCYC include [[drama]] competitions, spiritual workshops and [[seminars]], lectures by priests and bishops, prayer meetings, and social gatherings.  High school youth also enjoy presentations by a team of [[actor]]s, [[priests]], [[pranksters]], and techies.  OCYC is a spiritual and social event that any one can benefit from and yet enjoy at the same time. OCYC has strict christian values, and believes in good conduct, respect, agape love, and good sportsmanship.  Participants include copts from [[Toronto]], [[Mississauga]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], [[Brampton, Ontario|Brampton]], [[Ajax, Ontario|Ajax]], [[Scarborough, Ontario|Scarborough]], St. Catharines and other parts of the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. From the States, copts coming from [[Rochester, New York]] also attend. The convention is usually held on a [[university]] [[campus]] somewhere near the GTA.  The convention has been held on an annual basis since the early 1990's, but has become one of the most successful Coptic Conventions in North America since 2004. OCYC 2004 was the first occasion to establish a semi-permanent logo for the convention meetings taking place in the years to follow.  [[Category:Religious conventions]]</text>     </revision>

I do not think that having ''every single'' reference to an article neither in the article nor in English is meeting [[WP:V]]. This is the English Wikipedia, and as it stands it is impossible for most people in the world who choose to read this article to verify its contents. One or two of the sources even require registration! However, AGF says that the sources say what it is claimed they do and this only barely touches the two-thirds level, so I think a smerge to the school is probably enough. I'm just going to redirect and leave the merge to someone else from the history; painful detail about the headteachers upbringing would not work well in that article, nor would much more than a mention in the infobox. -[[User:Splash|Splash]]&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Splash|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 22:43, 6 March 2006 (UTC) ===[[Paul Lau]]=== '''Delete''' :Non-notable and also NPOV and a lot of nonesense--[[User:Rjstott|Rjstott]] 10:16, 27 February 2006 (UTC) *'''Delete''' as nn-bio. --[[User:Terenceong1992|Ter]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;e]]&lt;/font&gt;[[User:Terenceong1992|nc]][[User talk:Terenceong1992|e Ong]] 10:48, 27 February 2006 (UTC) *'''Strong keep''': The principal of one of the ten most famous schools in Hong Kong is more than enough of a notable person to be mentioned here. Moreover, the article is in this current non-neutral state only because it has received heavy vandalism from people against Paul Lau, which are anonymous users. If these vandalism materials are being reverted, the article is certainly neutral in general. The current state of the article without a biography section, is only a transitional state as if many other comprehensively-written biographies were at their early weeks. I believe with this proposal of deletion rejected, the article will certainly receive improvement and expansion. As an experienced editor on Wikipedia and a person who knows Paul Lau in real life, I'm certain that I can expand the contents of this article while keeping it neutral, provided that it's not being deleted right here.

The club was formed in 1993, and has won the WNBL Championship five times.  The team acquired the rather incongruous moniker of the &quot;Adelaide Fellas&quot; in a corporate naming rights agreement in 2005. They resumed use of the &quot;Lightning&quot; moniker in the 2006-07 season.  Their current team roster for the 2007-08 season is Lauren King, Rebecca Duke, Renae Camino, Samantha Woosnam, [[Angela Marino]], Jenny Whittle, [[Erin Phillips]], Jessica Foley, Tracy Gahan and Brittany Wilkins.  Wilkins was released by the club on October 17 with the club citing an inability to find a role for her within the team.  On that same day, the club attracted media attention when owner Vince Marino sacked Head Coach Chris Lucas. The incident was soon followed by both Assistant Coaches, an Individuals Coach, Team Manager, Team Doctor and Courtside Announcer quitting in protest.  Vicki Valk was named as the team's new coach on October 18, 2007.  ==External links==  *[http://www.adelaidelightning.com/lightning/ Official Adelaide Lightning website]  {{Adelaide Sports Teams}}  [[Category:Adelaide Lightning| ]] [[Category:Australian Basketball teams]]  {{Australia-basketball-team-stub}}  [[fr:Adelaide Lightning]]</text>     </revision>

Roschmann would strip prisoners of their clothes and huddle them together before [[execution]]. He also liked watching dogs feed on them while they were still breathing. The exposure of his activities earned him the infamous title of Butcher of Riga.  ==Escape and death== The advance of the [[USSR]]'s [[Red Army]] prompted Roschmann to move westwards with his SS unit, taking along the living inmates of the camp. The grueling retreat claimed the lives of thousands of the remaining inmates, who had virtually no food or clothing and being marched through snow-laden routes in freezing cold. With the approaching defeat of Germany, Roschmann escaped from the Soviet and Allied authorities in the guise of an army corporal. Sheltering amongst friends in Austria, he was twice apprehended by Allied authorities, but managed to escape both times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Forsyth  | first = Frederick  | title = The Odessa File  | pages = 152-56  | year = 1972  | publisher = Viking Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Making contact with an organization of SS fugitives, he was smuggled to a monastery in [[Rome]], which served as a major hiding place under the auspices of the monk [[Alois Hudal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Forsyth  | first = Frederick  | title = The Odessa File  | pages = 172  | year = 1972  | publisher = Viking Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Roschmann then travelled to [[Juan Peron]]'s Argentina, where the sympathetic government gave him citizenship. Roschmann was forced to leave Argentina in 1977 after [[West Germany]] requested his extradition. Shifting to [[Paraguay]], Roschmann died of a heart attack later in the year.  ==ODESSA== Roschmann is believed to have remained active in the [[ODESSA]] network, which aided SS refugees and attempted to re-infiltrate the institutions of modern Germany. He was featured as the main antagonist in [[Frederick Forsyth]]'s novel, ''[[The Odessa File]]'', and later in the [[The Odessa File (film)|1974 film]] based on the novel. His character was played by the [[Academy Award]]-winning Austrian actor [[Maximilian Schell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SW&quot;&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DF133FF930A25756C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 Wiesenthal suggests use of Roschmann in novel]&lt;/ref&gt; The novel describes much of Roschmann's actual life and deeds; the use of the character was suggested by the Nazi-hunter [[Simon Wiesenthal]], who believed that Forsyth's book could help track down the fugitive.&lt;ref name=&quot;SW&quot;&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DF133FF930A25756C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 Wiesenthal suggests use of Roschmann in novel]&lt;/ref&gt;  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==External links== *[http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=3454 Roschmann Photo and biography] *[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DF133FF930A25756C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;pagewanted=1 New York Times article with information about Roschmann's post-war movements] *[http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Latin_America/ClockworkOrange_COTP.html Post War Movement]  {{DEFAULTSORT:Roschmann, Eduard}} [[Category:1908 births]] [[Category:1977 deaths]] [[Category:Germans of Austrian descent]] [[Category:German military personnel of World War II]] [[Category:SS officers]] [[Category:Holocaust perpetrators]]  [[de:Eduard Roschmann]] [[fr:Eduard Roschmann]] [[it:Edward Roschmann]] [[ja:エドゥアルト・ロシュマン]] [[fi:Edward Roschmann]]</text>     </revision>

She was born in [[Istanbul]], Turkey and emigrated to France with her family at the age of two, where they lived initially in [[Nanterre]]. Her brother [[Mario Prassinos]] is an artist and illustrator.  Her writing was discovered by [[André Breton]] in 1934, when she was just fourteen, and published in the French surrealist magazine [[Minotaure]] and the Belgian periodical Documents 34. Her first book, ''La Sauterelle arthritique'' (The Arthritic Grasshopper) was published in 1935 with a preface by [[Paul Eluard]] and a photograph by [[Man Ray]].  [[Marianne van Hirtum]] observed that the surrealists of the time recognised these early writings as a &quot;veritable illustration of automatic language ''par excellence''&quot;.  After World War II Prassinos's association with organised surrealism was limited, but she has continued to publish widely.  == Bibliography == (incomplete)  * ''La Sauterelle Arthritique'' (GLM, 1935) * ''Quand le Bruit Travaille'' (GLM, 1936)  * ''La Revanche'' (GLM, 1939) * ''Sondue'' (GLM, 1939) * ''Le Temps n'est rien'' (Plon, 1958) * ''La Voyageuse'' (Plon, 1959) * ''La Gonfidente'' (Grasset, 1962) * ''Le Visage Effleuré de Peine'' (Grasset, 1964) * ''Le Grand Repas'' (Grasset, 1966) * ''Les Mots Endormis'' (Flammarion, 1967) * ''La Vie la Voix'' - Poésie (Flammarion, 1971) * ''Le Verrou'' (Flammarion, 1987)  * ''La Table de Famille'' (Flammarion, 1993)  == References ==  * ''Surrealist Women - An International Anthology'' (1998) - by [[Penelope Rosemont]]  {{DEFAULTSORT:Prassinos, G}} {{France-writer-stub}}  [[Category:1920 births]] [[Category:Living people]]  [[fr:Gisèle Prassinos]] [[pl:Gisèle Prassinos]]</text>     </revision>

He was a cousin of General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].  ==Biography== John Williams Stoddard was born in [[Dayton, Ohio]] to Henry and Susan (Williams) Stoddard. Henry Stoddard (1788-1869) was a pioneer citizen and distinguished lawyer of Dayton. John was educated in the private schools of Dayton, and spent his freshman and sophomore years at [[Miami University]]. He next entered the junior class at [[Princeton College]], where he graduated in the class of 1858. Following his father's profession, Mr. Stoddard graduated from [[Cincinnati Law School]] in 1860. He practiced law in Dayton for two years but decided to abandon the legal profession for a business career. In May 1861 John W. Stoddard married Susan Keifer (1841-1921).  In 1862 John Stoddard began the manufacture of [[linseed oil]] in partnership with his brother Henry, and Charles G. Grimes, under the firm name of Stoddard &amp; Grimes. That business was continued for three or four years when it was enlarged, and the manufacture of [[varnishes]] was added, the firm also dealing by wholesale in paints, oils, window glass, etc., under the name of Stoddard &amp; Company. In 1869, Stoddard sold his interest to his brothers. The company later became part of the Lowe Brothers Company of Dayton.  In 1869, John Stoddard then began the manufacture of agricultural implements in partnership with John Dodds, under the firm name of John Dodds &amp; Company. The Farmers Friend Manufacturing Company was incorporated as a stock company in 1871 as producers of high class agricultural implements constituting a complete line of [[sowing|planting]], [[harvesting]] and [[tillage|tilling]] machinery under the Farmers Friend, Excelsior, Monarch brands. This was succeeded by J. W. Stoddard &amp; Company and in turn, in 1884, was incorporated as the Stoddard Manufacturing Company, of which Stoddard was the president and principal stockholder. Their distinctive brand of &quot;Tiger&quot; was a mark of excellence in agricultural machinery the world over. The chief implements made by the Stoddard Manufacturing Company were [[mower]]s, [[hay rake]]s, [[seed drill|press drills]], and [[harrow (tool)|disc harrows]]. The best known of these were the famous Tiger Rake, Tiger Harrow, and Havana Press Drill. More than 200,000 of the Tiger Rake had been sold by 1890. In the mid-1890s, they diversified to take advantage of the [[bicycle]] craze then sweeping the United States, manufacturing the Tiger (and Tigress), Cygnet, and Tempest lines of bikes until 1898.  His interest in the financial possibilities of transportation was revealed by his involvement as Secretary in the Third Street Railway, five miles (8 km) of urban streetcar rails that ran the full length of Third Street in Dayton, and which gradually acquired other urban rail operators in Dayton. In the 1880s, Stoddard was also Vice President of [[Milburn Wagon Co.]], a Toledo, Ohio wagon manufacturer that originally built farm wagons but then evolved to produce bodies for [[Willys]] &amp; [[Pope-Toledo]] in 1909 and then several models and styles of its own electric vehicles from 1915-1923 called the Milburn Light Electric. Milburn was sold to [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in 1923.  In 1903, John W. Stoddard and his son Charles (1866-1921), having made a fortune in agricultural equipment, turned to making automobiles. John sent his son to Europe where he toured continental auto manufacturers. In 1904, Stoddard Manufacturing Company was reincorporated as Dayton Motor Car Company and they began the manufacture of the [[Stoddard-Dayton]] automobile. It became the second largest employer in Dayton, second only to Barney &amp; Smith, occupying the {{convert|68000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} plant at Third and McDonough Streets that had been built for the agricultural implements forerunner in 1871. That landmark stood until 1994.   The Stoddards competed in those years with other local Dayton companies including the [[Speedwell Motor Car Company]], the Dayton Electric Car Company, the Darling Motor Car Company, the Apple Automobile Company, and the Custer Specialty Company, but without question, the Stoddard-Dayton was one of the highest quality automobiles made in its time. In 1909, the Stoddards formed the Courier Car Company (effectively a division of Dayton Motor Car) to manufacture smaller, cheaper automobiles, heavy trucks and taxicabs. The Courier company occupied an earlier Stoddard building at Fourth Street and Wayne Avenue.  A Stoddard-Dayton won the first race at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] in 1909 and was the pace car in 1911 for the first [[Indianapolis 500]]. In 1910, the Dayton Motor Car Company was sold to [[United States Motor Company]] of Detroit, a rival of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]].  John W. Stoddard died in Dayton in 1917. His son and partner Charles Grimes Stoddard died less than four years later and Susan Stoddard, John's wife, died a few months after Charles. The Queen Anne-style Stoddard mansion stood on Grafton Hill overlooking the [[Great Miami River]] and the city of Dayton. In 1926, it was razed to make way for the Dayton Masonic Temple (now Masonic Center).  The John W. Stoddard family, including his parents, brothers and children, are interred at [[Woodland Cemetery, Dayton, Ohio]].  == Patents == Stoddard used patent protection on his agricultural products.

Fowler Stoddard, is below. *{{US patent|322136}} Combined Horse Rake and Tedder, Issued: July 14, 1885  == References == *The History of Montgomery County, Ohio. Chicago: W. H.

For many years he lived in [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]], [[Kent]] and died six months after [[Benny Hill]] died.  ==Career== One of the great stooges of television comedy, Todd was best known for his lugubrious expression and talent for slapstick, and was known to fellow comedians by the nickname &quot;Silly Todd&quot;.   Before working in television, Todd trained to be a dentist, before wartime service as a an RAF navigator in [[World War II]].  He had ambitions of becoming a farmer - making money from cattle breeding, whilst working as a manager at London Airport.  The farming business, once began, failed and almost made him bankrupt, so at the age of 42 he found himself looking for a new career.  Meeting scriptwriters [[Ray Galton]] and [[Alan Simpson]] in a pub, he bluffed them into believing that he was in fact an actor and ended up with the part of a policeman in the [[Sid James]] comedy series ''[[Citizen James]]'' in 1963.  He consequently stooged in ''[[The Dick Emery Show]]'' and ''[[The Mike and Bernie Winters Show]]'' amongst others, before joining ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]'' in 1969.  He stayed with the programme, on and off, which consistently topped the TV ratings, until [[Thames Television]] axed the show twenty years later.  Todd gained a reputation for [[drunkenness]] while working on 'The Benny Hill Show'. He once failed to turn up for a [[London Palladium]] show after a 'drinking episode', and eventually found himself in a [[Dublin]] hospital five days later.  After this was reported in the media, Hill had Todd dropped from the show.  Producer [[Dennis Kirkland]] persuaded Hill to rescind the decision, saying Todd brought much to the show and his drinking rarely affected his work.  Todd's only starring role was in his own 1972 series ''[[In for a Penny]]'' although he did appear in the [[Jimmy Jewel]] series ''[[Funny Man]]'' and in the film by Eric Sykes, 'Rhubarb' in 1970, as well as making guest appearances on shows by [[Jim Davidson]] and [[Allan Stewart]] and [[Spike Milligan]]'s ''[[Q9]]''.  He was also seen in cinema films, including ''[[Carry On Doctor]]'' and ''[[The Return of the Musketeers]]''.  Todd was referenced in the 1985 [[Half Man Half Biscuit]] song &quot;99% of [[Gargoyle]]s Look Like Bob Todd&quot;.  Todd and his wife, Monica, had one daughter and two sons.  He died at the age of 70.  ==External links== *{{imdb name|id=0865121|name=Bob Todd}} *[http://www.runstop.de/bennysplace/btodd.html Benny's Place tribute to Bob Todd]  {{DEFAULTSORT:Todd, Bob}} [[Category:1921 births]] [[Category:1992 deaths]] [[Category:English television actors]] [[Category:English comedians]] [[Category:People from Faversham]] [[Category:Royal Air Force airmen]] [[Category:Royal Air Force personnel of World War II]]  [[fr:Bob Todd]] [[pl:Bob Todd]]</text>     </revision>

He would have become a surgeon, but a certain marquis retracted his patronage, leaving Francisco's father in financial difficulties, hence the son became &quot;Paquiro&quot;, since he was not satisfied just being a mason. Flinging himself headlong into bullfighting, he relied on courage until he found art. However, the main reason that Paquiro is one of the most famous names in bullfighting history, is that he was the first person to write rules for bullfights and lay down an order for fights. He also introduced the &quot;Traje de Luz&quot;, the suit that the bullfighters wear to this day. There is a museum dedicated to him in his home town of Chiclana de la Frontera in Cádiz province. He finally occupied so great a position in bullfighting that around 1840 he was paid in [[Madrid]] 6,000 Spanish reals for killing five bulls. Two years later, he earned 2,000 per bull. Until 1848, when he retired, he was by far the most important bullfighter in Spain. He attempted to return to the ring after retirement, but was not the same as before. If the bull &quot;Rumbón&quot; on his last afternoon, on [[July 21]], [[1850]], in Madrid, did not kill &quot;Paquiro&quot;, he inflicted on him the most serious blow of his career. A shadow of himself, without ever again turning the flannel with his wrist, he died at forty-six years in his home town.   ==Quotes about him== :(''TEN MASTERS by Bernardo V.

Most recently, the term turnaround was described succinctly by Michael Cieply in ''The New York Times'' as a &quot;an industry term for arrangements under which producers can move a project from one studio to another under certain conditions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Studio War Involving ‘Watchmen’ Heats Up |author=Michael Cieply |date=2008-08-29 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/30/movies/30watc.html |accessdate=2008-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2008 article &quot;The Murky Side of Movie Rights&quot; further expands upon this definition, and elaborates upon the arrangements involved in several turnaround deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Murky Side of Movie Rights |author=Michael Cieply |date=2008-08-23 |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/business/media/24steal.html |accessdate=2008-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of films put into turnaround include: ''[[E.T.]]'' (from [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] to [[Universal Studios|Universal]]); ''[[Speed (film)|Speed]]'' ([[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] to [[Twentieth Century Fox|Fox]]); and ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (sold by [[Warner Bros.]] to [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] in exchange for the rights to ''[[Executive Decision]]'' and $600,000 in cash). The turnaround of [[The Boondock Saints]] is documented in ''[[Overnight]]'': A 2003 documentary which mainly focuses on the perspective of how director [[Troy Duffy]]  &quot;fell&quot; in Hollywood.  In certain situations the option to a screenplay may have expired, and instead of renewing at one studio, the option will be renewed at another studio according to the terms of the deal.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}  ==Further reading== * {{cite news |title=The Murky Side of Movie Rights |author=Michael Cieply |date=2008-08-23 |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/business/media/24steal.html }}  ==References and notes== {{reflist}}  [[Category:Film production]] [[Category:Intellectual property law]]</text>     </revision>

A [[monophonic (synthesizers)|monophonic]] [[analog (signal)|analog]] [[modular synthesizer]] equipped with a set of matrix switches to connect modules in addition to the more common patch cords. It used cords with 1/8&quot; ''miniphone'' connectors rather than the 1/4' cords used by the [[Moog Music|Moog]] synthesizers of the time. The main 2500 cabinet could hold 12 modules, and the optional wing cabinets could hold 6.  Although the 2500 proved to be a reliable and user-friendly machine, it was not commercially successful, selling approximately 100 units. A collection of the 2500's most popular modules was packaged into a single, non-modular unit as the [[ARP 2600]], leaving out the matrix switching and more esoteric modules.  The 2500's most notable usage was when it was employed in [[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]] to communicate with [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]].  The ARP technician sent to install the unit, [[Phil Dodds]], was cast as the musician. The unit featured in the film consisted of a fully loaded main unit, two fully loaded wing cabinets and dual keyboards in a custom case.  ==Famous users==  It has been used by artists such as [[Meat Beat Manifesto]], [[The Who]], [[David Bowie]], [[Skinny Puppy]], [[Jean Michel Jarre]] and [[Vince Clarke]]. In the classical world, electronic composer [[Elaine Radigue]] has worked almost exclusively with the 2500.  Contrary to popular belief, It was not the synthesizer used on [[The Who]]'s famous song, [[Baba O'Riley]]. The sequenced type motif used for this particular song was produced by a home organ. However, it can be heard on many of the other tracks, such as &quot;Bargain&quot;, &quot;Going Mobile&quot;, and &quot;The Song Is Over&quot; , on which the parts were overdubbed afterwards.  ==External links== *[http://www.vintagesynth.com/arp/2500.shtml Vintage Synth Explorer]  [[Category:ARP synthesizers]] [[Category:Modular synthesizers]]  [[nl:ARP 2500]]</text>     </revision>

Shak played [[college soccer]] at [[UCLA]] where he started out as a walk-on and became a starter, helping the Bruins to the [[NCAA Men's Soccer Championship|College Cup]] in 1997. He also played for the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S.]] on the Under-23 level. With the [[MetroStars]] coming off the worst season in MLS history in 1999, they were given the first pick in the [[2000 MLS SuperDraft]]. Despite Shak being projected to go in the third or fourth round, and such highly-rated prospects as [[Nick Garcia]], [[Carlos Bocanegra]], and [[Danny Califf]] on the board, the Metros drafted Steve. The team's head coach, [[Octavio Zambrano]], coached Shak on youth teams.  Shak spent a year and a half with the MetroStars, playing on defense as well as midfield, scoring a goal and an assist. Late in the 2001 season, he was traded to the [[Colorado Rapids]] for [[Ross Paule]]. He was gone from MLS after playing a solitary minute in 2002. Shak  was a [[replacement player]] for a brief period in 2005 during the U.S. national team labor dispute.  Since then, Shak has been a mainstay in the [[United Soccer Leagues]], playing for both the [[Minnesota Thunder]] and the [[Virginia Beach Mariners]]. When the Mariners folded in early 2007, Shak switched to the [[Charlotte Eagles]].

Roughly a mile south west of [[Marske-by-the-Sea]] and set on a hillside, it was originally a group of [[miner]]'s [[terraced house]]s.  1966 saw the development of what was originally known as Errington Park Estate the development of which ended in 1984, when the development of a 14 hole golf course was supposed to take place. [[Image:New Marske From Errington Wood.jpg|thumb|left|New Marske seen from Errington Wood]] New Marske has no railway station, but the closest, [[Longbeck railway station]], links to [[Saltburn]], [[Middlesbrough]] and [[Darlington]]. New Marske is situated near an area of woodland called [[Errington Woods]], in which are the remains of disused mine workings. There are several farms in the vicinity, and there is a primary school (first opened in the 1970s to replace the old school house) serving the recently-built housing estate. The recent building of housing on the old primary school site has meant that the other school of the village has been extended to cater for the new children and closing of the old school. This new housing reflects the rapid growth of villages in the area.  Among the residents of New Marske the old terraces are referred to as the village and the newer houses are referred to as the estate.   There is a small row of shops known locally as the &quot;top shops&quot; due to their position uphill from the older part of the village. This is generally considered the centre of the village. This row of shops now includes a newsagent, bakery, Chinese take-away, pizzeria, hairdressers, and corner shop.  Originally the 'Top shops' consisted of the [[VG (shop)|VG]], Chinese takeaway, laundrette, wool shop, butchers, bakers (Hills), newsagent, and fruit and veg shop.   Another set of shops is located at the northern end of the village, along with the three pubs that serve the surrounding area along with a [[Methodist]] church and a [[Church of England]] parish - St Thomas which famously hosts a large crucifix which was hand-crafted by a local man named Harold Brotton. There is a sub [[post office]] within the terraces of Dale Street in the village.   The original mining settlement has recently been commemorated, in the way of a series of plaques placed at various locations, depicting events and scenes of life in the 1800s. Also remnants of the mining era remain in the way of disused [[shaft mining|shaft]]s in Errington Woods. Some have been filled in or covered over, but some are still accessible.  Errington Woods has recently undergone a transformation due to a reduction of trees. The reason quoted was to encourage the population of butterflies in the area. The woods are also used by many for downhill [[mountain biking]], with many tracks and areas having been cleared out over the years.  An excellent reference book was written by Ena Holloway who came to live in New Marske in 1971, and the Rev Alan Hughes entitled &quot;New Marske Looking Back&quot;. This book is unfortunately out of print, but local libraries do have copies.  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{Redcar and Cleveland}} [[Category:Redcar and Cleveland Borough]] [[Category:Locations in the Tees Valley]] [[Category:Villages in North Yorkshire]]   {{Redcar-geo-stub}}</text>     </revision>

It is a small village just off the [[A174 road|A174]], a 2 minute drive away from Eston. Lazenby is very small, and has just one shop, two pubs and a social club. The remaining shop was the village post office until 2008, when it was closed despite the fierce objections of villagers, although it remains in business as a general store.

The news of his death was greeted in his native [[Scotland]] by rioting in which several lost their lives. He is buried close to where he fell in the village of [[Hanslope]], [[Buckinghamshire]].

This is type of dating is the norm in modern articles about the English Civil War. See [[Old Style and New Style dates]] for more details on this issue.&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[English Civil War]], and was fought between the [[Roundheads|Parliamentarians]], under [[Sir William Brereton]], and the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] supporters of [[King Charles I of England]], under Sir [[Thomas Aston (cavalier)|Thomas Aston]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p2836.htm#i28356 Sir Thomas Aston]&lt;/ref&gt;  ==Background==  In the summer of 1642 came the final split between the King and Parliament and both sides made preparations for raising an army. Throughout the summer [[Arrayer|Commissioners of Array]] for the King and [[Deputy Lieutenant]]s for Parliament attempted to raise the [[Trainband|trained bands]] and to seize the [[wiktionary:magazine|magazine]] in every county. During the confusion caused by the troops waiting to be shipped from [[Chester]] to [[Ireland]] to suppress the rebellion there, Sir William Brereton, the Parliamentary representative in Cheshire, turned to what was virtually recruiting. He found himself opposed by Sir Thomas Aston and all the resident Cheshire nobility and he failed in his attempt to secure Chester for Parliament.  At this time Aston was probably the recognized representative of the King in the county and was able to present the latter with a list of men willing to serve in the King's army. The King decided to base this army at [[Shrewsbury]] and when he arrived there on the [[20 September]] [[1642]] he wrote to [[Robert Needham, 2nd Viscount Kilmorey|Lord Kilmorey]], [[Robert Cholmondeley, 1st Earl of Leinster|Lord Cholmondeley]] and &quot;the other of the subscribers for Horse in Cheshire&quot; telling them to deliver their horses into the charge of Aston who was to bring the forces raised to Shrewsbury to join with the main body of the army. Charles made it unnecessary for Aston to leave for Shrewsbury as he instead came to Chester and it was from here that he issued, on the [[26 September]], an order for the seizure of arms and horses from those people who had carried out Parliament's [[Militia Ordinance]] in Cheshire. These were to be delivered to Aston who was able to leave with the King at the head of three troops of horse.  Sir Thomas obviously conducted himself satisfactorily in the campaign culminating in the [[battle of Edgehill]] because an order from [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] in January 1643 refers to him as a colonel of a regiment of cuirassiers, and two days later on the [[19 January]] the King announced that he was sending Aston as a Major-General to Cheshire and Lancashire. Aston's orders were simply stated by Prince Rupert; he was to take his regiment to Shropshire, raise forces of horse and foot there, and then defend Cheshire against the Parliamentary force that was heading to the county from London under the leadership of Sir William Brereton. He was also to seize arms and ammunition for the King's use and &quot;put into execution the laws and customs martial upon all offenders.....for the better preventing of disorders, plunderings and outrages which are often committed by soldiers.&quot; He was told to achieve this and return to the main army by the [[15 March]] unless he received orders to the contrary.  The preparations for Aston's march and arrival in Cheshire reveal the King's interest in keeping Cheshire Royalist. The authorities of the areas that Aston was to pass through on his way from [[Oxford]] to Cheshire were ordered to provide food and lodgings for his men. The Cheshire Commissioners of Array were also given explicit orders as to what they should do to help Aston. The King explained to them that as the Parliamentarians had rejected the [[Bunbury Agreement]] and were sending a force to Cheshire, he was sending Aston and his regiment of horse to protect the county. The Commissioners were to assemble the trained bands and summon [[Quarter Sessions]] to decide on a method of raising money to pay the soldiers. They were also to help Aston raise a regiment of dragoons (mounted infantry armed with muskets) and seize arms from &quot;malignants&quot; to arm them. In addition the parishes were to supply horses for mounting them.   Parliament also realised how important Cheshire was and sent Sir William Brereton to raise support for its cause. Professor Eric Ives summed up the importance of Cheshire in a lecture given in July 2001. Geographically Cheshire lies between the Pennines and the Welsh hills and so whoever controlled Cheshire controlled the north – south corridor. For Parliament the control of Cheshire would mean separating the King's northern supporters from the King and his army at Oxford. It could also stop the King bringing in reinforcements from his Irish army through the port of Chester. '&lt;ref name=&quot;ives&quot;&gt;[http://www.brereton.org/professor_eric_ives.htm Lecture given to the worldwide Brereton Family Reunion]&lt;/ref&gt;  When Sir Thomas arrived in Shropshire he found that there were only 60 dragoons instead of the 600 promised. The authorities promised him another 200 and so he decided to wait for two days before moving on to Cheshire. During this time he was ordered to [[Stafford]] to help the sheriff there (perhaps against the Moorlanders who had risen for Parliament). However Sir Thomas did not neglect his prime objective and ordered the Cheshire Commissioners of Array to defend [[Nantwich]] with 150 musketeers and to inform him of Brereton's progress. Neither order was carried out and Aston was not informed until it was too late to arrive at Nantwich before Brereton.  ===The skirmish at Nantwich=== Sir William Brereton meanwhile had ridden into [[Congleton]] on the evening of [[27 January]] with his own troop of horse and three companies of dragoons. Although he was joined in Congleton by the ex-Mayor William Edwards with another troop of horse, his whole force could not have amounted to more than about 500 men. His mission, however, was not to conquer Cheshire but to rouse and organize the Parliamentary sympathizers in it. He had with him the cadre of a foot regiment, a case of Drakes (small cannon about 7½ feet long) and 700 muskets in his baggage train as well as an experienced Scottish professional, Major James Lothian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotwars.com/html/james_lothian.htm Major James Lothian. A short history of a Scots professional soldier in Cheshire]&lt;/ref&gt; to train recruits. He had wide powers to construct fortifications and raise more men and was to finance the whole enterprise by voluntary payment and [[wiktionary:distraint|distraint]] upon the rent and goods of local Royalists.  He approached Nantwich on the 28th not just &quot;to releave the town, beinge in greate danger to be plundered and destroyed by the Kings Armye and Commissioners of Array&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;malbon&quot;&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/brigaban/malbon.html|Malbon’s Memorials of the Civil War]&lt;/ref&gt; but also because it offered the only alternative to Chester as a county headquarters. It had sufficient wealth and housing to accommodate a large garrison and staff and was the centre of a network of roads leading to the [[Midlands]] and [[London]], to North [[Wales]], [[Lancashire]], [[Yorkshire]] and [[Scotland]].   Brereton sent ahead 50 dragoons under Major Lothian to occupy the town and they got there before Aston who had finally been informed of Brereton's progress by [[Sir Orlando Bridgeman, 1st Baronet, of Great Lever|Orlando Bridgeman]], the son of the Bishop of Chester. Aston had with him his own troop of horse and some companies of Shropshire dragoons under the command of Colonel Sir Vincent Corbett&lt;ref&gt; [http://website.lineone.net/~corbett_group/First/People/dragoon.htm| The Corbett Study Group]&lt;/ref&gt; totalling about 500 men. Despite his superiority of numbers Aston failed to take the town and at dusk he retreated eastwards down Hospital Street. In a narrow lane his force met the remainder of Brereton's force and confusion was the result. A company of Brereton's dragoons dismounted but failed to leave anyone to control the horses which bolted into the fields and were taken by the Royalists for charging cavalry. The confusion was added to when some Parliamentarians loaded and fired one of the drakes. This does not seem to have caused any injury but the flash and the roar amid the general confusion frightened the Royalists so much &quot;that they weire all scattered and quyte Rowted&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;malbon&quot;/&gt;  Aston turned up eventually at Whitchurch and although he claimed the skirmish as a draw, his distance from Nantwich and his appeals for reinforcements would indicate that the skirmish was a defeat for the royalists. In his defence it must be noted that his men were exhausted after the long march from Oxford and that he did not receive the support from the Cheshire Commissioners of Array that he had expected. This lack of proper support continued over the next four or five weeks. An agreement was made to raise a contribution in the county to pay the soldiers but most was paid to the upkeep of the Chester garrison, not to Aston's regiment or to the trained bands. The Royalist leaders were never able to agree to a unified command which meant that they were never able to field an army that would outnumber Brereton's force. There was a force of 2,000 men at Warrington under the Earl of Derby, a Welsh force of 1,000 men at Chester and the Shropshire force at Whitchurch. These never combined and indeed it was not until March that the Royalists decided to choose a place in the county &quot;to summon in the King's friends&quot;  ==Prelude== Aston set out for Middlewich on Friday [[10 March]]. His progress was delayed that night when his men mutinied for pay. Apparently the money and provisions were issued on Saturday but it was so late that Aston had to leave two troops of horse in the forest to guard it - &quot;though they lay in danger that night.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PhillipsAston&quot;&gt;Sir Thomas Aston's Account to the Commissioners of Array for the County of Chester. Document XVII in J. R. Phillips, Memoirs of The Civil Wars in Wales and the Marches, Vol 2, pp 56 – 61 (London, 1874)&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known why Middlewich was chosen as opposed to the much safer [[Knutsford]] where it would have been possible to retreat to [[Warrington]] if necessary. In his account of the battle of Middlewich Sir Thomas did not say why he came to Middlewich on [[11 March]] but explained that he had no wish to linger there. He realized the dangers of staying in an open town with enemy forces at both [[Northwich]] and Nantwich. Sir William Brereton, who was recruiting in Northwich, commented on the boldness of the Royalists for camping at Middlewich. He believed it resulted from overconfidence in their ability to win over the county and rid it of the Parliamentarians.   ===Saturday 11 March=== Aston arrived at Middlewich with about 500 mounted troops and over 1000 of the trained bands of the [[Broxton (hundred)|Broxton]] and [[Hundred of Wirral|Wirral]] [[Hundred (division)|Hundred]]s plus 3 cannon. William Brereton sent a strong party of horse from Northwich &quot;who gave them an alarm.&quot; Aston had meanwhile received a letter from the Governor of Chester, Sir [[Nicholas Byron]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=19198 A History of the County of Chester: Volume 5 (i)]&lt;/ref&gt; telling him that if he provided an escort for [[William Brereton, 2nd Baron Brereton|Lord Brereton's]] family and goods to Chester then the latter, who was a relative of Sir William Brereton, would provide men for Aston. The latter, in consultation with the sheriff, Sir [[Edward Fytton]], and Colonel Ellis decided it was worth staying. Sir Thomas was reluctant to linger in Middlewich and therefore sent a letter to Lord Brereton urging him to act straight away even though it meant travelling on Sunday.  ===Sunday 12 March=== Brereton, wanting &quot;to annoy our enemy&quot;, set out with 2 or 3 companies of dragoons to give alarm at Middlewich. He had no intention of attacking but wanted to harass the Royalists. In the meantime Lord Brereton had not done as Aston requested but instead came to Middlewich to confer further. Sir Thomas believed that Lord Brereton's presence in Middlewich led to the attack by the Parliamentarians because they wanted to prevent the Royalists from joining forces. Sir William however, in his account of the battle, made it clear that he attacked because he believed a Royalist presence in Middlewich posed too much of a threat to be ignored.  In order to confer with Lord Brereton and also the sheriff’s desire to &quot;sumon the countrey with theire contribucon and assistance, necessitated a ioynt consent to stay there on Monday.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PhillipsAston&quot;/&gt;  Realising the danger posed by this decision Aston asked that the Governor use the Whitchurch forces to threaten the Parliamentarians at Nantwich. According to the Commissioners of Array the Whitchurch force was not ordered to threaten Nantwich. In any case the forces there had been disbanded. Aston's fears were well founded as Brereton arranged to meet the Nantwich forces at 6 o'clock the next morning and to make a joint attack on Middlewich.  ==The Battle== On the morning of Monday [[13 March]] the Nantwich forces had not arrived at the appointed time so Brereton decided to attack with his cavalry and about 200 musketeers (&quot;our greatest force of foot being at Nantwich&quot;). He &quot;with the best forces hee had theire came early in the mornynge backe to Midlewiche, &amp; vpon Sheathe Heathe att the west end of the said Towne, Sr Thomas Aston havinge taken the advantage of the said ground &amp; wynde, &amp; planted his ordnance, sett upon him&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;malbon&quot;/&gt;  Sir Thomas sent a party of dragoons and horse under Captain Spotswood to give an alarm at Northwich, presumably to draw off some of Brereton's force. The Captain, however, disobeyed orders and engaged the enemy and as a result Brereton's forces were able to establish themselves in one street leading into the town. In another street Captain Prestwich and his men were caught unawares by the enemy but were able to rally and drive back the enemy horse and rescue some prisoners. He stopped at a bridge and managed to hold off the enemy until the foot soldiers arrived. Waring Bridge was also approached by the enemy so Aston sent Captain Prestwich and his troop to aid Captain Massie's company of foot defend it. In this way Aston was able to hold off the enemy until about 9 or 10 am when the Nantwich force arrived &quot;so resolutely and with such undauntedness of spirit.&quot; About 800-foot and 300 horse came down Booth lane and entered into Newton at the south end of the town, where Aston had placed &quot;a good Brasse peece of ordnance&quot; and two trained bands of 200 men who were &quot;well advantaged by ditches and bankes on both sides.&quot; Aston withdrew a troop of horse under the command of Captain Bridgeman from the Northwich approach to check the advance of the Nantwich force. The rest of his horse he held back behind the foot, &quot;there being noe other ground for horse&quot;, apart from a force of about 60 to attack the enemy. His plan was to line the hedge with about 100 musketeers so that the enemy could not take advantage of the ditches on both sides of the lane to attack the charging horse.  The Parliamentary force, on finding the lane so well defended, took to the fields on either side of the lane. The Royalist horse could not charge because of the hedges and the musketeers deserted as soon as the first shots were fired at them. The horse was therefore outflanked and cut off by the enemy musketeers on both sides of the lane. On the west side of the town the troop of horse, under Mayor Thomas Holme, were managing to hold off the Parliamentarians despite the fact that Bridgeman's troop had been withdrawn to defend the southern entrance. However, when Sergeant Major Gilmore ordered his foot to retreat the horse were outflanked by enemy musketeers on either side of the lane behind the hedges where the horse could not charge. They were therefore forced back into the town. The street was defended by musketeers behind a breastwork but they ran away after firing once at random. Similarly the foot soldiers guarding Waring Bridge were ordered to retreat and the Parliamentarians were able to enter the town from there. Meanwhile the horse on the Nantwich approach were pulled back to allow the use of the cannon that Captain Ellis had drawn up.   The Parliamentarians were advancing towards [[St. Michael and All Angels, Middlewich|St Michael and All Angels church]] from three directions so Aston ordered a party of Captain Spotswood's dragoons to secure and defend the churchyard. He also placed a guard at the breastworks on the west side of town and put a cannon in the churchyard to cover the street. A company of musketeers and two trained bands were brought up to hold off the advancing Nantwich force. These musketeers lay down in the ditches as soon as they came to Ellis's cannon and it was all Aston could do to get them up to the hedges with the other musketeers by riding among them &quot;and with my sword I beat them up.&quot; This served no purpose because the soldiers would not lift their heads to see where to fire but instead shot their muskets into the air.  The Parliamentarians meanwhile had become encouraged by the inaccurate fire of the cannon and they charged the Royalist foot who promptly ran away, leaving Aston's cavalry exposed and unable to charge because of a large ditch. They therefore drew off to a safer position. Seeing this, a body of pikemen behind a breastwork further back ran away and &quot;all the musqueteers placed for the defence of the street ende quit their trenches, having never seen the enemy or cause of feare, but their fellows flying.&quot; Sir Thomas, however, held his cavalry firm until Colonel Ellis could draw off his cannon and then ordered a retreat to the high street. Aston himself went to the churchyard expecting it to be defended as he had ordered. Instead he found all the foot soldiers in the church and he could not &quot;draw out ten musqueteers out of the church would it have saved the world.&quot;  Relying on his two cannon to cover two streets, Aston ordered his cavalry, being exposed to the advancing enemy on three sides, to regroup in a field at one end of the town. However, their way was blocked by a barricade erected by Captain Spotswood and they became separated and were unable to regroup until they were well past Kinderton House.  Returning to the cannon Sir Thomas found that one had been deserted and the other being drawn off by a solitary cannoneer. With all the other men, including Colonel Ellis, in the church and refusing to come out, Sir Thomas was now alone: &lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;The enimy falling directly in three streets upon me, and discharging upon me in the church-yard, the horse marched out of sight. I alone, all I could possibly hope to doe was to rally the horse again if possible, to wheel about, and to fall in the rear of them&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PhillipsAston&quot;/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; 	 In the maze of streets Aston lost contact with his cavalry, apart from a few stragglers, and had little hope of turning the disaster into success especially as the Parliamentarians had now taken the church. With it they captured Colonel Ellis, Sergeant-Major Gilmore, Sir Edward Moseley, ten captains and other officers, 400 common soldiers, weapons for 500 men, two barrels of matches, four barrels of powder and two cannon. It is hardly surprising that Brereton should believe that &quot;since the beginning of this unnatural war, God hath not given many more complete victories.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PhillipsBrereton&quot;&gt;Battle of Middlewich, March 13, 1643 - Sir William Brereton's Account. Document XVI in J. R. Phillips, Memoirs of The Civil Wars in Wales and the Marches, Vol 2, pp 54 – 55 (London, 1874)&lt;/ref&gt;  ==The Aftermath== ===Sir Thomas Aston=== Sir Thomas sent a messenger to rally his cavalry at [[Northwich|Rudheath]] intending to go on to Brereton and collect Lord Brereton's force. The cavalry were, unfortunately, beyond recall and so Aston went on his own to give an account of the battle and to see if Lord Brereton was still willing to support him. Finding that he was, Aston returned to Whitchurch to raise the Shropshire forces. However, the trained bands there had been disbanded leaving Sir Thomas no alternative but to return to Cheshire, rally his men and await his fate. He summed up his feelings about the battle thus: &lt;blockquote&gt;			               &quot;It is the plain truth, the enemy having no diversion, but att liberty with their full power to fall on us from all parts, were much too hard for us in a place not defensible. And without some more experienced foot officers, I must freely say no number will be found sufficient to withstand ready men.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PhillipsAston&quot;/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; He was withdrawn to Oxford and continued to command a cavalry regiment in the King's Field Army. In 1644 he fought as a Brigadier of cavalry in [[Prince Maurice von Simmern|Prince Maurice's]] army in the West of England and fought at the second Battle of Newbury but probably never returned to Cheshire, (although at least two sources mention him being there in 1644).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pardoes.com/abo/history.htm Welcome to Acton Bridge] states that during the Civil War in 1644 Sir Thomas Aston's men exercised &quot;all manor of outrages and intollerable taxes. They plundered Weaverham and the country about, carried off old men out of their houses, bound them together, tyde them to a cart and rove them through mire and water to that dungeon, where they lie without fire or light and now through extremities are so diseased, they are ready to give up the ghost.&quot; but does not state the source of the quote. Also John Vicars (see Online Sources below) stated that Brereton during the siege of Nantwich in 1644 &quot;won a most famous Victory of the Lord Capell and the Lord Byron.....and Sir Thomas Aston also&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1645 Sir Thomas served in the West Country under [[George Goring, Lord Goring|George Goring]] until September or October when he decided to return home. He passed through [[Kidderminster]] and [[Stourbridge]] on his way to Cheshire. At the beginning of November he was captured by a Parliamentary force under the command of a certain Captain Stones &quot;att or neere Banke&quot; (possibly near [[Walsall]]) along with about 60 Royalists - presumably Cheshire men who had fought in Aston's regiment and who were also returning home. From there he was taken to prison and placed under arrest. On the [[24 March]] [[1646]] Sir Thomas Aston died of a fever brought on by his various wounds, including a blow to the head received during an unsuccessful attempt to escape.  ===Sir William Brereton=== Sir William Brereton declared God responsible for him winning the battle: &lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;I desire the whole praise and glory may be attributed to Almighty God, who infused courage into them that stood for His cause, and struck the enemy with terror and amazement.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PhillipsBrereton&quot;/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; By the end of the spring Parliamentary forces, with Brereton as commander-in-chief, controlled five of the seven Hundreds of Cheshire. From this time on through to February 1646, when the last remaining royalist base at Chester surrendered to him, the county was dominated by Sir William and he proved to be a dynamic war-time leader not just militarily but also politically and administratively. According to Professor Ives, because of the importance of Cheshire, Sir William Brereton  &quot;had more influence on the outcome of the First English Civil War than Oliver Cromwell had.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ives&quot;/&gt;  He suffered his only major defeat in December 1643 at [[Second Battle of Middlewich|Middlewich]]. In 1646 when peace returned and his control over Cheshire came to an end, Brereton moved south to become an active London-based MP and politician. As a reward for his services he received the Chief Forestership of the Forest of Macclesfield and the [[wiktionary:seneschal|Seneschalship]] of the Hundred of Macclesfield. In 1651 he received the tenancy of the former archbishop's palace at [[Croydon]] in [[Surrey]] and he spent the last nine years of his life commuting between here and his ancestral home at [[Handforth]], in Cheshire. He died on the [[7 April]] [[1661]] in Croydon and is presumed to have been buried in the family vault in the church at [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]] in Cheshire.  ==Notes== &lt;references/&gt;   ==Online Sources== [http://www.brereton.org/harold_forster.htm Sir William Brereton 1604 – 1661]                                      Author: Harold Forster MBE&lt;br /&gt;                                                                                  [http://www.stirnet.com/HTML/genie/british/aa/aston01.htm Aston of Aston family tree]&lt;br /&gt;                              [http://www.cheshirehistory.org.uk/Papers/chesh1630-60.htm Conflict and Consensus:]                                  The Central Regimes and Cheshire, c.1630 - c.1660. by Peter Gaunt&lt;br /&gt;                                                  [http://website.lineone.net/~corbett_group/First/People/dragoon.htm Sir Vincent Corbet, his Dragoons]               A Provisional History of the Regiment by Stephen Pickstock©&lt;br /&gt;                                                           [http://www.scotwars.com/html/james_lothian.htm Major James Lothian]                                            A short history of a Scots professional soldier in Cheshire by Garry Scott, Loudoun's Regt.&lt;br /&gt;                      [http://www.geocities.com/brigaban/burgmem.html Burghall’s ‘Providence Improved’]&lt;br /&gt;                                   [http://www.geocities.com/brigaban/malbon.html Malbon’s Memorials of the Civil War]&lt;br /&gt;                                  [http://www.geocities.com/brigaban/appendices.html Appendices to the above.

It is an over-the-top spoof loosely inspired by ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' and other horror films from the same period.  ==Synopsis==  The film opens in 1975 at a place called Headstone Manor, which is being used as a &quot;businessman's weekend retreat and girls' summer camp&quot;. A few minutes into the film, a group of [[satan]]ic [[monk]]s enter the house and kill 18 of its occupants (the 19th, played by [[Cleo Rocos]], being the sole survivor). The murders were committed using the following methods: [[Image:Bloodbathhousedeath.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Vincent Price]] plays the Sinister Man in the film]] *Two were axed to death. *Two had their throats slit. *One man was hanged. *Two girls were struck by lightning. *One man watching underwent [[spontaneous human combustion]] and blew up. *Four were stabbed to death. *Six were frozen to death in the Manor's freezer.  In 1983, Doctor Lucas Mandeville ([[Kenny Everett]]) and Doctor Barbara Coyle ([[Pamela Stephenson Connolly]]) are sent to investigate [[radioactive]] readings in the area that have been traced to Headstone Manor, now known by locals as the House of Death.  Along with several other scientists, Mandeville and Coyle set up their equipment in the house, while the Sinister Man ([[Vincent Price]]), a 700-year-old [[Satanism|Satanic]] priest, prepares a rite in the nearby woods to purge the house of its unwanted guests.  During this time, Mandeville reveals that he was once a successful [[Germany|German]] [[surgeon]] named Ludwig Manheim, who was reduced to &quot;smart-arse [[paranormal]] research crap&quot; after a humiliation in the past. Coyle also encounters a [[poltergeist]], and the two engage in [[sexual intercourse]].  Several satanic clones of Mandeville, Coyle and the other scientists have entered the house, and begin killing off the originals and taking their place.  When Coyle is about to be killed, she is rescued by the poltergeist and saved. The satanic monks then take off in a spaceship, revealing that these monks are [[extraterrestrials|aliens]] using the house for their activities on Earth. The film ends with the spaceship soaring into the skies, with an [[E.T.]] voice groaning: &quot;Oh, shit! Not again!&quot;  ==Filming== The film was shot entirely on location at [[Potters Bar]] in [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britmovie.co.uk/genres/horror/filmography/053.html Bloodbath at the House of Death (1984)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  ==Release== [[Image:Bloodbath book.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The book based on the film]] The film was released in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Thorn EMI]], and was considered by critics to be very poor.  Martyn Auty wrote: &quot;Presumably intended as high camp; looks like low-grade [[Carry On films|''Carry On'']].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell's Film Guide.&lt;/ref&gt; It was given an [[18 certificate]] in the United Kingdom.

This [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] is heated to temperatures of between roughly 10 and 100 million [[Kelvin]] and consists mainly of [[ionised]] [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], containing most of the [[baryonic]] material in the cluster. The ICM strongly emits [[X-ray]] radiation.  ==Heating== The ICM is heated to high temperatures by the [[gravitational energy]] released by the formation of the cluster from smaller structures. [[Kinetic energy]] gained from the [[gravitational field]] is converted to [[thermal energy]] by [[shock wave|shocks]]. The high temperature ensures that the elements present in the ICM are [[ionised]]. Light elements in the ICM have all the [[electrons]] removed from their [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]].  ==Composition== The ICM is composed primarily of ordinary [[baryon]]s (mainly ionised hydrogen and helium). This plasma is enriched with heavy elements, such as [[iron]]. The amount of heavy elements relative to hydrogen (known as [[metallicity]] in astronomy) is roughly a third of the value in the [[sun]].  Most of the baryons in the cluster (80-95%) reside in the ICM, rather than in the luminous matter, such as galaxies and stars. However, most of the mass in a galaxy cluster consists of [[dark matter]].  Although the ICM on the whole contains the bulk of a cluster's baryons, it is not very dense, with typical values of 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; particles per cubic centimeter. The [[mean free path]] of the particles is roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; m, or about one lightyear.   The strong gravitational field of clusters means that they can retain even elements created in high-energy [[supernova]]e.  Studying the composition of the ICM at varying [[redshift]] (which results in looking at different points back in time) can therefore give a record of element production in the universe if they are typical&lt;ref&gt;Loewenstein, Michael. ''[http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310557 Chemical Composition of the Intracluster Medium]'', Carnegie Observatories Centennial Symposia, p.422, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;.  ==Observing== As the ICM is so hot, it mostly emits [[X-ray]] radiation by the [[bremsstrahlung]] process and X-ray [[emission lines]] from the heavy elements. These X-rays can be observed using an [[X-ray telescope]]. Depending on the telescope, maps of the ICM can be made (the X-ray emission is proportional to the density of the ICM squared), and X-ray [[spectrum|spectra]] can be obtained. The brightness of the X-rays tells us about the density of the gas. The spectra allow temperature and metallicity of the ICM to be measured.  The density of the ICM rises towards the centre of the cluster with a strong peak. In addition, the temperature of the ICM typically drops to 1/2 or 1/3 of the outer value in the central regions. The metallicity rises from the outer region towards the centre. In some clusters (e.g. the [[Centaurus cluster]]) the metallicity of the gas can rise above that of the sun.  == Cooling flow == As the ICM in the core of many galaxy clusters is dense, it emits a lot of X-ray radiation (the emission is proportional to the density-squared). In the absence of heating, the ICM should be cooling. As it cools, hotter gas will flow in to replace it. This is known as a [[cooling flow]]. The ''cooling flow problem'' is the lack of evidence of cooling of the ICM.  ==See also== * [[galaxy cluster]] * [[intergalactic medium]]  ==References== {{Reflist}}  [[Category:Galaxy clusters|*]] [[Category:Large-scale structure of the cosmos]] [[Category:Extragalactic astronomy]] [[Category:Astronomical objects]] [[Category:Space plasmas]] [[Category:Plasma physics]] [[Category:Intergalactic media]]  {{astronomy-stub}} [[ja:銀河団ガス]]</text>     </revision>

It differs from many other festivals in that it moves location every year, being hosted and organised by student folk societies. The fact that it is run almost entirely by current students is another large factor that differentiates it from many other folk events. However, it can also be expected to attract ex-students and random folkies, descending on the host [[university]] for a weekend of [[Folk music|music]], dance, song and [[sleep deprivation]]. The festival is always run in either the last weekend in February or the first weekend in March; the next festival is due to occur in [[Exeter]] from the 27th Feb to the 1st March 2009.   == History  ==  The festival was started in 1951 and took place at the [[University of Leeds]]. Since then it has been roaming UK universities from the north ([[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]] in Scotland) to the south ([[University of Exeter|Exeter]] in Devon):   *'''2009''' is happening in Exeter, between the 27th February and the 1st March 2009. Booking of the venues is now confirmed and contracts exchanged. All events will be back on one site, including sleeping, food and all the late night sessions.  [http://www.exeter.ac.uk/ivfdf2009 2009 Festival website] *'''2008''' [[Sheffield]]. The festival ran between 29th Feb to the 2nd March. Bands and artists appearing were Glory Strokes (Pete Rees), Vertical Expression (Andrew Swaine), Gloworms (Nick Walden), Janiver (formed from previous Jabadaw members), Triple Scotch.  There was also a concert with Crucible, Spiers &amp; Boden.  There were over 1000 visitors to the festival. *In '''2007''' the venue moved up north to Edinburgh University from the 2nd-4th of March. Bands included Peeping Tom and John Dipper, Various demonstration dances including Scottish and a dance to the soundtrack of &quot;[[The Sound of Music]]&quot; and diverse workshops. *In '''2006''' it was held on the 24th-26th of February by [[Cambridge University]] with a committee made up of students and ex-students belonging to the universities' three folk orientated societies (Gog Magog Molly, The Round and The Strathspey and Reel Society). Because Cambridge does not have a single large [[students union]] building they hired a local school to accommodate the 1000+ attendees. Workshops held in various rooms, including the gym and sports hall, sessions in the library and common room, and sleeping in the maths classrooms. Lots of dance teams turned up, including '''Stone the Crows''', '''Black Swan Rapper''', and '''Pig Dyke Molly''' as well as the usual complement of university-based teams from all over the country. *'''2005''' [[Norwich]] *'''2004''', Exeter *'''2003''', Sheffield *'''2002''', [[St. Andrews]] *'''2001''', Cambridge *'''2000''', [[Glasgow]] *'''1999''', Exeter *'''1998''', Sheffield *'''1997''', Cambridge - Held mainly at Anglia Polytechnic University and venues around the city.

To use the '''ifstream''' class, [[fstream]] library (header file) must be included using the [[preprocessor]] directive: #include &lt;fstream&gt;  The input stream may open a file in the constructor:  &lt;code&gt; ifstream inf(&quot;input.dat&quot;, ifstream::in);  &lt;/code&gt;  or afterwards:  &lt;code&gt; ifstream inf; inf.open(&quot;input.dat&quot;);  &lt;/code&gt;  To close a stream, one uses the &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt; method: &lt;code&gt;inf.close();&lt;/code&gt;  The ifstream destructor will close the file cleanly as well.  It is perfectly acceptable to allow the ifstream object to fall out of scope without calling &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt;.  This is often a desirable style, as it simplifies the &quot;clean up&quot; process when an exception is thrown or an error is otherwise encountered.  == References == [http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/ifstream/ Tutorial from CPlusPlus.com]  [[Category:C++]] [[Category:C++ standard library]]  [[de:C++-Standardbibliothek]] [[fr:C++ standard library]] [[vi:Thư viện chuẩn C++]]</text>     </revision>

The '''salience''' (also called '''saliency''') of an item – be it an object, a person, a pixel, etc. – is its state or quality of standing out relative to neighboring items. Saliency detection is considered to be a key [[attention]]al mechanism that facilitates [[learning]] and survival by enabling organisms to focus their limited [[perception|perceptual]] and [[cognitive]] resources on the most pertinent subset of the available [[sensation|sensory]] [[data]]. Saliency typically arises from contrasts between items and their neighborhood, such as a red dot surrounded by white dots, a flickering message indicator of an answering machine, or a loud noise in an otherwise quiet environment. Saliency detection is often studied in the context of the [[visual perception|visual]] system, but similar mechanisms operate in other [[sensation|sensory]] systems.  When attention deployment is driven by salient stimuli, it is considered to be bottom-up, [[memory]]-free, and reactive. [[Attention]] can also be guided by [[top-down]], [[memory]]-dependent, or anticipatory mechanisms, such as when looking ahead of moving objects or sideways before crossing streets. Humans and other animals cannot pay attention to more than one or very few items simultaneously, so they are faced with the challenge of continuously integrating and prioritizing different [[bottom-up]] and [[top-down]] influences.        The [[hippocampus]] participates in the assessment of salience and context using past memories to filter new incoming stimulus; placing those that are most important into the long term memory.  The [[entorhinal]] cortex is the pathway into and out of the hippocampus and is damaged early on in [[Parkinsons disease]].  ==Salience in psychology== Distinctiveness, prominence, obviousness. The term is widely used in the study of perception and cognition to refer to any aspect of a stimulus that, for any of many reasons, stands out from the rest. Salience may be the result of emotional, motivational or cognitive factors and is not necessarily associated with physical factors such as intensity, clarity or size.  ==External links== * [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11256080&amp;query_hl=2&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum A review of research on visual saliency from a computational perspective] * [http://ilab.usc.edu/ iLab at the University of Southern California] * [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Visual_Salience Scholarpedia article on visual saliency] by Prof. [[Laurent Itti]]  [[Category:Cognitive neuroscience]] [[Category:Neuropsychology]] [[Category:Attention]]  [[de:Salienz]] [[ru:Салиентность (нейробиология)]]</text>     </revision>

It is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 along with [[Drayton, Portsmouth|Drayton]] and [[Wymering]] (mainland) and Bocheland ([[Buckland, Portsmouth|Buckland]]), Frodington ([[Fratton, Portsmouth|Fratton]]) and Copenore ([[Copnor]]) on the island.    The name is of [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] origin (shown by the -ham suffix) and means &quot;Cossa's homestead&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names&lt;/ref&gt; It was predominantly {{pronEng|ˈkɒsəm}} (Coss-am) until the latter half of the 20th century, since when standard usage has become {{IPA|/ˈkɒʃəm/}} (Cosh-am).  Until the 1920s it was a separate small village surrounded by fields (including on the north end of [[Portsea Island]]).  Extensive suburban growth then expanded around the village and both east and west along the slopes of [[Portsdown Hill]].  It has been for many years a local route centre; [[Cosham railway station]] was also the terminus for City [[tram]]s and [[trolleybus]]es from the south and [[Portsdown and Horndean Light Railway]] trams to the north (until 1938).  The High Street is a significant local shopping centre.  Few traces of the original village now remain; the oldest houses (Chalk Cottage of 1777 and Mile Stone Cottages of 1793) were demolished in the 1960's and replaced by a car park, but the old milepost showing mileage to [[London]], [[Petersfield, Hampshire|Petersfield]] and [[Portsmouth]] remains. The interior of St Philip's Church (1938) in Highbury is cited as a fine example of [[Ninian Comper]]'s work.  Cosham is also home to the UK headquarters of [[IBM]] UK Ltd. The site known as 'North Harbour' was built in the 70's, the location being selected due to the job cuts by the [[Royal Navy]] during the time.  ==References== {{reflist}}  [[Category:Portsmouth]]</text>     </revision>

She earned fame with her twin sister, Virginia, at the Miss Tulsa beauty pageant in 1927 as they were both elected to win the contest.  A winning coin flip earned Meredith a trip to the [[Miss America]] pageant of 1928 where she finished as a runner-up.  Her experiences at Miss America led to a five-year stint as a performer with the [[Ziegfeld Follies]], where she worked with such legendary stars as [[Eddie Cantor]], [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ed Wynn]].  In 1935, Meredith joined [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios]] in [[Hollywood, California]] working in public relations, advertising, and fashion, working directly with [[Louis B. Mayer]].  While at MGM, Meredith continued to model with her sisters, Virginia and Mary, who starred in several films for MGM at that time.  From 1937 to 1941, Meredith took a job with [[Crowell-Collier]] publishing in [[Washington, D.C.]] with their advertising department.  In addition to her work in advertising, Meredith wrote two syndicated columns: “At Random” under her own name, and “Selective Tuning” under the name Jean Abbey on the Washington, D.C. social scene and women’s fashions.  Already well known in Washington as a writer and radio commentator, Meredith made a bigger splash further west in [[Arizona]] with her marriage to Arizona Congressman [[Richard F. Harless]].  With the outbreak of [[World War II]], Meredith concentrated on her writing and radio career with the [[Hecht Broadcasting Company]].  In 1940, she became the first woman to broadcast a presidential inauguration, and the first woman to have her own radio commentary show.  In addition to her broadcasting work, Meredith volunteered with the [[Treasury Department]] to raise a total of $250 million dollars worth of war bonds, worked with the [[Civilian Defense Home Hospitality Committee]], the [[Stage-Door Canteen]], and the [[Russian War Relief]] Committee.  In addition to her wartime charitable work, Meredith founded the [[United Nations Club]] in December 1941.  With the participation ambassadors of 58 countries, the United Nations Club became one of the major social organizations promoting the allied war effort and post-war charitable initiatives of the United States.    In 1948, Meredith returned to Arizona to campaign for her husband's bid for governor.  After a brief stint with [[KTAR (AM)|KTAR]] radio during the campaign, in 1949 she became the producer of “A Look Behind the News” for CBS in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], where she also was a regular commentator.  For the next several years Meredith would write, produce and star in several radio and television programs for stations throughout the valley, including “Arizona Close-Ups” for NBC and “Arizona Caravan” for ABC, where she worked as Public Relations Director.  Her efforts earned her Arizona’s Outstanding Woman award in 1951.    Meredith continued to work in local Arizona broadcasting as well as participating in local charities such as the [[Salvation Army]], where she served as Vice President for the national organization, and Washington D.C. organizations including the Washington Fashion Group, the National Symphony Orchestra, and the Business and Professional Women’s Club.  She actively worked in many charitable organizations and local community efforts until her death on June 19, 1996 at the age of 87.  ==Source== Meredith Harless Papers (Mss. 167).

It is the fifth generation of [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]]s built and marketed by [[Chevrolet]] and was replaced by the [[Chevrolet Corvette C6 | C6]] model.  == Summary == The C5 was a radical change from the previous generation. Designed from the outset as a sturdy [[convertible]] (as opposed to a [[coupé]] that was subsequently weakened by the removal of the roof structure in order to accommodate demand for a convertible model), the car now had a [[Hydroforming|hydroformed]] box frame.  The transmission was moved to the rear of the car to form an integrated, rear-mounted [[transaxle]] assembly which was connected to the all-new [[GM LS1 engine|LS1]] engine via a [[torque tube]]; this engine/transmission arrangement helped facilitate a desirable 50-50 (percentage, front-rear) weight distribution for the vehicle.  The LS1 engine initially produced 345&amp;nbsp;[[Horsepower|hp]], but that was increased slightly in 2001 to {{Convert|350|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.  The [[GM_4L60-E_transmission|4L60-E]] [[automatic transmission]] carried on from previous models, but the [[Manual transmission|manual]] was replaced by a [[Borg-Warner T-56 transmission|Borg-Warner T-56 6-speed]].  Gone were the squeaks and rattles of the [[Chevrolet Corvette C4|C4]]&lt;ref name=&quot;The Immortal Corvette: 1997-2003&quot;&gt;The Immortal Corvette: 1997-2003[http://www.automedia.com/The_Immortal_Corvette_19972003/res20031201c5/1/]&lt;/ref&gt;, and in replacement was an incredibly strong frame that would last for at least two more generations{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. By all measures, the new C5 was better in every aspect than the C4 it replaced.  The styling of the C5 was also a departure from the trend set by the previous-generation Corvette.  Whereas the styling of the C4 had largely been a simplification of the [[Chevrolet Corvette C3|C3]] [[hatchback]] design, straightening out the complex curves of the car to give it sleeker lines, the C5 reversed that somewhat.  The vehicle now had a more rounded and graceful appearance that helped to recapture some of the aggressive looks of the C3 without compromising [[Automotive aerodynamics|aerodynamics]].  In the inaugural model year (1997), only the hatchback coupé was offered, with the convertible — the first to offer a trunk since 1962 — following in 1998.  1998 also saw the C5 convertible [[Pace (speed)|pacing]] the [[Indianapolis 500]], and a replica [[pace car#Indianapolis_500|pace car]] edition was sold; C5 Corvettes subsequently paced the 2002 and 2004 Indianapolis 500 races, but no replica pace car versions were offered during those model years.  In 1999, a third body style, the [[hardtop]] (also referred to as the &quot;fixed-roof coupé&quot; or &quot;FRC&quot;), was added to the lineup.  This body style, as its name suggests, featured a fixed top (no removable [[targa top]] panel as with the hatchback coupé) with a roofline shape and trunk space similar to that of the convertible.  The hardtop became the top-performance [[Chevrolet Corvette C5#Z06|Z06]] in 2001, but for two model years was offered as a variant of the base-model Corvette.  Aside from cosmetic differences (new rim styles, paint colors, pace car/commemorative editions in 1998, 2003, and 2004, etc.), horsepower boosts, and new offerings for optional equipment, there were few fundamental changes from one model year to the next within the production run of the C5.  One of the more popular &quot;high-tech&quot; options introduced to the Corvette line was a [[Head-up_display#Automotive_applications|head-up display]] or HUD, while another innovation was the [[Chevrolet Corvette C5 Z06#Active Handling|Active Handling System]] (first available as an option in 1998, then standard on all models in 2001).  In contrast to the (largely deserved) reputation of high-performance vehicles for poor [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], the C5 achieves comparatively high [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] ratings of 18/26 [[Fuel economy in automobiles|mpg]] (city/highway) with the automatic transmission, and 19/28 with the manual transmission, allowing it to avoid the &quot;[[Energy Tax Act#Gas_guzzler_tax|gas guzzler]]&quot; tax that is levied against most other vehicles in the Corvette's class.  A number of factors are responsible for this:  first is the relatively light weight of the C5 (a [[curb weight]] under {{convert|3300|lb|abbr=on}}; Chevrolet went so far as to omit the spare tire as a weight-saving measure, relying upon [[Run-flat tire|run-flat tires]] instead); second is the C5's low [[Automobile drag coefficients|drag coefficient]]; and third is the vehicle's tendency to upshift into the higher gears as soon as possible (which with the manual transmission's Computer-Aided Gear Shifting, results in an obligatory shift from 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; gear directly into 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; gear under certain driving conditions, although this &quot;feature&quot; of the manual transmission can be inhibited through the use of an aftermarket device).  Suspension choices for the base model C5 were limited to the standard suspension ([[Regular_Production_Option|RPO]] FE1), with options for either the [[autocross]]-inspired FE3 Sport Suspension (included with the Z51 Performance &amp; Handling Package and standard on the 1999-2000 FRC); or the F45 Selective Ride Control Suspension, which permitted &quot;on-the-fly&quot; driver selection of different ride characteristics (sport or touring).  Late in the production run (starting with the 2003 model year), the F55 [[Magneto rheological damper|Magnetic Selective Ride Control Suspension]] replaced the F45 as the third suspension choice.  The racing-inspired FE4 suspension used for the Z06 is stiffer again than any offered on the base model C5, and is unique to that model with no optional suspensions offered.  Although sometimes criticized for its arguably liberal use of light-weight materials (e.g., plastics, [[plywood]], etc. in areas such as interior trim components), [[overhead valve]] engine, and reliance upon [[Corvette leaf springs|leaf springs]] in its suspension, all of which were often (and perhaps unfairly) interpreted as &quot;cheap-and-easy&quot; substitutes for higher-quality materials or more sophisticated designs, the C5 quickly became regarded as the best performance vehicle available for the price.  In some cases, the C5 provided performance equal to, or better than, vehicles approaching 2-3 times its sticker price, which buyers of the C5 viewed as an acceptable trade-off for these &quot;lower-cost&quot; compromises.  ==Z06== {{Infobox Automobile generation |name=Z06 |image          = [[Image:Z06-Blk-7.jpg|250px|A Corvette Z06.

Instead of a heavy, double-[[Overhead camshaft|overhead cam]] engine like the ZR-1, the Z06 used a high-output, tuned version of the standard LS1 Corvette engine (designated [[GM LS6 engine|LS6]]), which initially produced 385&amp;nbsp;hp (287&amp;nbsp;[[Watt#Kilowatt|kW]]). Although its total horsepower output was less than that of the last ZR-1, the Z06 was much lighter, and could out-perform the ZR-1 in every category except top speed.  It also cost substantially less money than the ZR-1.  Chevrolet engineered several modifications for the Z06 to best use the increased power.  Starting with the most structurally rigid body style, the hardtop or FRC, new components included: uprated FE4 suspension, larger wheel rims and tires, revised gearing ratios, and functional brake cooling ducts. The Z06 is 38 pounds lighter than a standard C5 hardtop thanks to weight-saving measures such as a titanium exhaust, thinner glass, lighter wheel rims, non-EMT tires, reduced sound proofing, fixed rear radio aerial, and a lighter battery. Starting with the 2002 model year, the LS6 engine output was increased to 405&amp;nbsp;hp (302&amp;nbsp;kW) due to a larger cfm air intake, stiffer valve springs, lighter sodium filled valves, more aggressive camshaft lift and timing, lighter pistons, and revised engine block.  The 2004 Z16 Commemorative Edition was equipped with a carbon fiber hood, saving an additional 10 pounds of weight.  Other unique characteristics of the Z16 (Commemorative Edition Z06) are the polished aluminum rims, special paint color and striping, and commemorative-edition badging and wheel center caps.  The Z16 also received shock damping tuning for improved handling.  The Z16 option accounted for the majority of Z06 Corvettes in 2004, totaling 2025 units, with 325 units shipped overseas.  Factory performance figures for the {{Convert|405|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of the Z06 give an acceleration time from 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph as 3.9 seconds. Owner-drivers have reportedly achieved impressive quarter-mile times of 11.7&lt;ref name=&quot;GM High Tech Performance&quot;&gt;Supercar Killer Chevy's '04 Z06 does 11s bone stock--and so much more[http://www.gmhightechperformance.com/features/0410htp_2004_z06_corvette_feature/]&lt;/ref&gt; seconds. The Z06 is capable of matching or besting the 0-60 acceleration times of some of the world's premier sports cars, including the [[BMW Z8]], [[Ferrari 360]], and [[Porsche 911#996_Turbo_.282000.E2.80.932004.29|Porsche 911 Turbo (Type 996)]].  ==Indianapolis 500 Pace Car Replica== [[Image:Corvette Indy.jpg||left|thumb|150px|1998 Corvette Indianapolis 500 Pace Car Replica&lt;BR&gt;(NOTE:  rear [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] on this example is not factory equipment)]] In 1998, the newly-introduced convertible version of the C5 was chosen to pace the Indianapolis 500 race, and a '''Pace Car Replica''' (RPO Z4Z) was offered to the public.  Aside from lacking the equipment necessary for actual pace car duties ([[Emergency vehicle lighting|light bar]], special racing harnesses, etc.), there was little difference between the Pace Car Replica C5 and the vehicle that actually saw duty during the race&lt;ref&gt;&quot;http://www.corvetteactioncenter.com/history/press/1997/11061997_3.html&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Pace Car Replica package consisted of a special paint color (&quot;Radar Blue&quot;), unique interior colors (black and yellow), painted yellow rims, and special pace car decals.  The Pace Car Replica package also included other optional equipment:  the newly-introduced Active Handling System (RPO JL4); an electronically-tuned AM/FM radio with CD player and a Bose speaker system; an electronic dual-zone heating &amp; air conditioning system; and leather adjustable sport bucket seats.  While regarded by many (including Corvette fans) as the most garish Corvette appearance package offered to date, the 1998 Pace Car Replicas nevertheless enjoy a strong and loyal following of owners and collectors. &lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;  ==50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Anniversary Edition== [[Image:2004 Chevrolet Corvette 50th Anniversary.jpg|left|thumb|150px|2003 50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Anniversary Edition (coupé)]] A '''50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Anniversary Edition''' (RPO Z25) was offered during the 2003 model year to commemorate a half-century of Corvette production.  Available as either a hatchback coupé or convertible (no Z06 version offered), the 50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Anniversary Edition came with a special shade of red paint (&quot;Anniversary Red Metallic&quot;) and shale two-tone leather interior; Anniversary Edition convertibles were adorned with a shale-colored soft top as well. A new option for Corvette in 2003, the F55 Magnetic Selective Ride Control Suspension was standard on the 1SC-equipped Anniversary Edition vehicles. Special champagne-colored painted aluminum rims, embroidered upholstery trim, and badges completed the Anniversary Edition package. Also included were all of the convenience options offered on the upscale Corvette models.  A slightly modified 50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Anniversary Edition Corvette was chosen to pace the Indianapolis 500 race in May 2002; then the production vehicle became a centerpiece of the subsequent 50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Anniversary Celebration, sponsored by Chevrolet. Festivities included gatherings in [[Nashville]], Bowling Green, and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. Thousands of Corvettes and their owners arrived from all over the country to participate in the events marking the vehicle's 50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; year of production.&lt;ref name=&quot;anniversary-registry&quot;&gt; {{cite web | title = 50th Anniversary Corvette Registry | publisher = General Motors Corporation | url = http://www.50thregistry.com/ | accessdate = 2006-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;  ==24 Hours of Le Mans Commemorative Edition== During the 2004 model year, a '''24 Hours of Le Mans Commemorative Edition''' package (RPO's Z15 &amp; Z16) was offered as an option for all three C5 models (hatchback coupé, convertible, Z06) in celebration of the C5-R &quot;1-2&quot; in-class finishes at Le Mans.  The package consisted of a special paint color (&quot;Le Mans Blue Metallic&quot;); shale two-tone leather interior (coupés and convertibles only); and wide, silver-and-red stripes optionally applied down the center of the car (Z06 only). Commemorative Edition convertibles received a shale-colored soft top, and the Z06 version (dubbed the &quot;Z16&quot; after its RPO for the Le Mans Commemorative Edition) received a carbon fiber hood as a further weight-reduction measure.  Special commemorative badging, headrest embroidery, and brightly-polished wheel rims (a first on the Z06) with unique centercaps completed the package.  ==C5-R== {{Main|Chevrolet Corvette C5-R}} The C5-R was a racecar built by [[Pratt &amp; Miller]] for GM Racing. It was based on the C5 road car but had a longer wheelbase, wider track, an enlarged 7.0&amp;nbsp;L [[V8]] and different bodywork with exposed headlamps. It is raced in the [[American Le Mans Series]] in the GTS Class and has been to four [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] races. * '''2001''' The car's remarkable 2001 racing season produced eight victories in ten races, including an overall win in the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and a one-two finish in the GTS class at Le Mans. * '''2002''' In 2002 the C5-R repeated its one-two victory at Le Mans and also dominated the GTS class in the American Le Mans Series. A new transaxle unit replaced the previous year's separate transmission and differential. Corvette faced stiff competition from the new [[Prodrive]] [[Ferrari 550]], which led for a good number of laps but had problems late, leaving the victory to Corvette. * '''2003''' In 2003, the Automobile Club de l'Ouest placed additional restrictions on all 24 Hours of Le Mans competitors, reducing power by 10% in an attempt to slow the cars. At the 2003 season-opening [[12 Hours of Sebring]] race, the C5-Rs remained in winning form, with one of them finishing first in class and eighth overall. Also in 2003 the yellow paint was dropped in favor of a special red, white, and blue color scheme to commemorate the Corvette's 50th anniversary. However, at Le Mans the Prodrive Ferraris spoiled the anniversary and hopes for a three-in-a-row victory in the GTS class. * '''2004''' Corvette C5-R came back in 2004 and won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in their class. The Prodrive Ferrari led most of the race, but with under 12 hours to go both the Prodrive cars had problems causing them to pit and lose laps.  The Corvettes went on to finish 1-2, with the #64 car finishing 16 laps ahead of the lead Ferrari. * '''2005''' Although in the process of becoming superseded by the C6-R, the Corvette C5-R was not finished with its racing successes. In [[FIA GT]], the new Corvette Europe team won races at Imola and Zhuhai. The Euro team also managed a number of podium finishes. In the ALMS, the Pacific Coast Racing team achieved some podiums behind the factory C6-R. * '''2006''' The C5-R returned to Le Mans (France) for the first time as a non-factory entry, run by Le Mans regular Luc Alphand. It finished third in the GT1 class behind the C6-R and Prodrive [[Aston Martin]].  * '''2007''' Alphand's squad will again run the C5-R at the Le Mans 24 Hour race, in pairing with a C6-R acquired from Corvette Racing.  ==Production Notes== {|class=wikitable !Year!!Production!!Base Price!!Notes |- align=right |1997||9,752||$37,495||align=left|[[GM LS engine#LS1|LS1]] engine is new; the [[hatchback]] [[coupé]] is the only body style offered |- align=right |1998||31,084||$38,995||align=left|Convertible C5 debuts with the first trunk in a Corvette convertible since 1962;&lt;BR&gt;[[pace car#Indianapolis_500|Indianapolis 500 Pace Car]] Replica offered; [[Chevrolet Corvette C5 Z06#Active Handling|Active Handling System]] introduced as optional equipment |- align=right |1999||33,270||$39,777||align=left|Less-expensive [[hardtop]] coupé is offered as a base-model body style |- align=right |2000||33,682||$40,900||align=left|Newly-styled alloy rims debut |- align=right |2001||35,627||$41,475||align=left|Hardtop coupé body style becomes top-performance Z06, utilizing the new [[GM LS6 engine|LS6]] engine and suspension improvements;&lt;BR&gt;[[Chevrolet Corvette C5 Z06#Active Handling|Second-Generation Active Handling System]] becomes standard equipment on all models; slight (5&amp;nbsp;hp) increase in base model engine power |- align=right |2002||35,767||$42,450||align=left|20&amp;nbsp;hp (14.9&amp;nbsp;kW) increase for the Z06 |- align=right |2003||35,469||$45,895||align=left|50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Anniversary Edition package offered for base models;&lt;BR&gt;F55 Magnetic Selective Ride Control Suspension supersedes F45 Selective Ride Control Suspension as base-model option |- align=right |2004||34,064||$46,535||align=left|24 Hours of Le Mans Commemorative Edition package offered for all models |- !Total!!248,715!!!! |}  ==See also== {{commonscat|Chevrolet Corvette C5}} * [[Chevrolet Corvette]]  ==Notes and References== {{reflist}}  {{Corvette timeline}}  [[Category:Chevrolet Corvette|C5]]  [[fi:Chevrolet Corvette C5]]</text>     </revision>

He was the son of a dentist, born in [[Oradea]] (Hungarian: Nagyvárad) [[Romania]]. Wagner studied at [[Budapest]] Art Academy before and after the [[World War II]]. He had three art periods as living in Hungary (1945-56), Sweden(1956-1971) and Japan(1972-97) respectively. He became well known for his novel cast stainless steel sculptures made in Sweden and Japan.   He and his Japanese wife Chiyo Wagner established the [[TAO Research Institute of World Culture and Development]], which continues to support education of young talented artists and promotion of the arts in Mashiko. They also initiated the establishment of Academia Humana Foundation in Hungary, which has been operating since 1999.  He died in Moka near his studio on 15th of November, 1997. The place for his grave was selected and prepared by him in the garden of his Mashiko studio.  ==Sculpture== [[Image:Corpus.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Sculpture &amp;ndash; Corpus Hungaricum (1951 unveiled 1999)|''Corpus Hungaricum'', (1951) bronze, [[Szekesfehervar]], [[Hungary]].]]  After the war in his studio at Ybl Bazár in Budapest he created statues: the ''Corpus Hungaricum'', ''[[József Attila]]'' the poet and ''Sorrow of Mother'' among others. Jointly with Zoltán Farkasdy architect they won first prize with their plan titled ''Fountain with three boys'' at the competition for art composition to Jászai Mari square just at the foot of the Margit Bridge in 1955. Besides and parallel to making sculptures he organized the local historical collection at St. István Museum of [[Székesfehérvár]] with placing the objects found at excavations in a correctly reconstructed environment created by artist between 1952-56. This activity has been recognized and honored by the [[British Museum]].  He gave courses in art to talented students who were refused to enter universities before the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]]. He was elected to be a board member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Artist during the revolution. He worded his adherence as: ''We who are working at the museums had only one oath: to protect the Hungarian culture with all our strength, without any condition!'' Called upon art students to take drawing tools instead of guns to record the moments of revolution on the streets for the future.  After the Soviet army suppression of the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] he had to leave [[Hungary]] and [[Sweden]] received him and his family. Soon he established his studio in [[Lund]]. He invented a new calculation method how to overcome the shrinkage problem at casting large-scale statues and art objects from stainless steel. Eight such monuments were erected around the country among them ''War Memorial for Polish Soldiers'', ''Tranås'', ''Fountain with four children'' and ''Clown''. He was very active and inventive also in painting and drawing. He developed a novel painting technique, which he named as paper fresco. Here basically the paper pulp was carried up in few centimeters thickness and the paint was applied to color some part of the pulp itself, but after drying chiseling was also applied to get the paper fresco final form.   [[Image:4gyerek.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sculpture &amp;ndash; Four Children (1964)|''Four Children Fountain'', (1964) cast stainless steel, Eskön, [[Sweden]].]] [[Image:Dosojin1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sculpture &amp;ndash; Patron Saint of Travelers(1964)|''Patron Saint of Travelers'', (1974) cast stainless steel, [[Narita]], [[Japan]].]]  In [[Sweden]] he was active with industrial design as well, got a patent for a new line of street lightning fixtures and also a model chair to ergonomic design has been developed by him. Although the Swedish period of his life was perhaps the most productive but privation and hardship came along with it and he was driven away from his family. At the [[Art Academy of Lund]] he was teaching drawing based on his skeleton support approach a novelty again. Here at the Academy he met Chiyo Akiyama art student who became his wife and partner for the rest of his life.  [[Image:foldanya.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Sculpture &amp;ndash; Earth Mother (1976)|''Earth Mother'', (1976) bronze, situated outside Takanawa Pair City, [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].]]  The third period of his life started in [[Japan]] in 1969, where his art opened at full scale. First the Wagner couple built a studio by themselves in [[Mashiko]] [[Tochigi ken]], primarily known for its local pottery [[Mashiko]] ware. The studio was ready and he got clay in his hand on 31 of December 1970 and ''Mother with Child'' a terracotta piece was born. His name was founded in Japan by wining the contest of creating large size art objects for the hotel area of the [[New International Tokyo Airport]] in [[Narita]]. A six-meter tall two figure the statue of ''Patron Saint of Travelers (Dosojin)'' was erected and also a 12m in diameter rainbow fountain was placed in front of Narita View Hotel both made from stainless steel. Also he got the commission to design and construct the surrounding park.   [[Image:Silkroadterakotta.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Sculpture &amp;ndash; From Silk Road series(1974-75)|''Terakotta figures of Silk Road series'', (1974-75) Zen no Roka Exhibition Hall [[Mashiko]], [[Japan]].]]  Parallel to sculpting he started to paint fine aquarelles and creating more ceramics. His terakotta series ''Silk Road'' contains 32 figures which are representing a step by step change in the composition starting from the typical Orient flame shape to the well known traditional European presentation forms of man, animal, bird and flower. This series is an example how to connect the sculpting styles of Orient and Occident gradually using the stylistic element along the [[Silk Road]].  In [[Mashiko]] the Garden of Philosophy was born an important spiritual message to the current and next generations. This composition was made in peace and harmony but not to make money he  said.   [[Image:Tetsugaku.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Garden of Philosophy (2001)|''Garden of Philosophy'' on the side of Gellert hill [[Budapest]], group of eight statues for better mutual understanding]]  He wrote: The ''Garden of Philosophy'' is exactly the step toward this direction. It is created to start from one centre. Around this centre point there are three rings. The first one is a complete ring around the centre point. The five figures ([[Abraham]], [[Echnaton]], [[Jesus]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Lao Tse]]) around the centre point are symbolising different culture of the world. They made the ideas and became founder of main religions of the world. The centre of each religion has different name like [[Kamisama]], [[Hotokesama]], [[Isten]] or [[Allah]] but itself is not different. The second ring is the group of people from different culture and time who resulted in spiritual enlightenment and everyone in the same way they acted this result in practice in their society (Mahatma [[Gandhi]], [[Daruma Taishi]] and [[Saint Francis]]). The third ring is a group of people of law in different country and different time. They made a law, which became mainstream of existing laws of today. They are [[Hamurabi]], [[Justinianus]] and [[Shotoku Taishi]]. This road of the ''Garden of Philosophy'' shows development of human kind and time brings us the question for necessity of new common law of the world to be discussed.  Three complete sets were cast one for [[Japan]], one for [[Hungary]] and one for [[USA]]. The group of statues that was presented to Hungary in 1997 was unveiled on the Gellért hill on 18th of October, in 2001.  ==References== * ''Tibor Wehner: Wagner Nándor - The Philosopher Sculptor''.

[[Image:TebbeRgtEquil.png|500px|center|Tebbe reagent equilib]]  Also analogous to the Wittig reagent, the reactivity appears to be driven by the high oxophilicity of Ti(IV).  The [[Schrock carbene]] ('''1''') reacts with carbonyl compounds ('''2''') to give a postulated oxatitanacyclobutane intermediate ('''3''').  This cyclic intermediate has never been directly isolated, presumably because it breaks down immediately to the produce the desired [[alkene]] ('''5''').  [[Image:Tebbe Reagent Mechanism.png|center|500px|The reaction mechanism of methylenation using the Tebbe reagent]]  ==Scope== The Tebbe reagent is used in [[organic synthesis]] for carbonyl methylenation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pine1993&quot;&gt;Pine, S. H. ''Org. React.'' '''1993''', ''43'', 1. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;Beadham2005&quot;&gt;Beadham, I.; Micklefield, J. ''Curr. Org. Syn.'' '''2005''', ''2'', 231-250. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;  This conversion can also be effected using the [[Wittig reaction]], although the Tebbe reagent is more efficient especially for sterically encumbered carbonyls.  Furthermore, the Tebbe reagent is less basic than the Wittig reagent and does not give the β-elimination products.  Methylenation reactions also occur for [[aldehydes]] as well as [[esters]], [[lactones]] and [[amides]].  The Tebbe reagent converts esters and lactones to enol ethers and amides to enamines.  In compounds containing both ketone and ester groups, the ketone selectively reacts in the presence of one equivalent of the Tebbe reagent.   [[Image:TRmethylenation.png|500px|]]  The Tebbe reagent methylenates carbonyls without racemizing a [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] α carbon.  For this reason, the Tebbe reagent has found applications in reactions of sugars where maintenance of [[stereochemistry]] can be critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = A. Marra, J. Esnault, A.

As in the above reactions, the Tebbe reagent converts the carbonyl group to a [[methylene]] group, but the intermediate Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO reacts further to form a titanium enolate by replacing Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.

Until 1807, the Thaler was subdivided into 32 ''Albus'', each of 12 ''[[Heller (money)|Heller]]''. It was worth three quarters of a [[Conventionsthaler]].  Between 1807 and 1813, the [[Westphalian thaler|Westphalian Thaler]] and [[Westphalian frank|Westphalian Frank]] circulated in Hesse-Kassel.  The Thaler and Heller were reintroduced in 1813, but without the Albus (the last coins denominated in Albus were issued in 1782). Thus, 384 Heller = 1 Thaler. In 1819, the Thaler was set equal to the [[Prussian thaler|Prussian Thaler]]. In 1841, a new currency system was introduced, dividing the Thaler into 30 ''[[Silbergroschen]]'', each of 12 Heller.  The Thaler was replaced at par by the [[Hesse-Kassel vereinsthaler|Vereinsthaler]].  ==References== {{refbegin}} *{{numis cite SCWC|date=1979}} {{refend}}  ==External links== {{Standard numismatics external links | world_coin_gallery_1_url  = Germany | world_coin_gallery_1_name = Germany | banknote_world_1_url      =  | banknote_world_1_name     =  | dollarization_1_url       =  | dollarization_1_name      =  | gfd_1_url                 = Germany | gfd_1_name                = Germany | gfd_data_1_url            =  | gfd_data_1_name           =  | show_gfd_excel            = Y }}  {{Thaler}}  {{Money-unit-stub}} {{Germany-hist-stub}} [[Category:Currencies of Germany]] [[Category:Modern obsolete currencies]]  [[it:Tallero dell'Assia-Kassel]]</text>     </revision>

Dodik graduated from the Faculty of Political Science at the [[University of Belgrade]].   ==Political career== From 1986 through 1990 he was the President of the Executive Board of the Municipal Assembly of Laktaši (i.e. the municipal &quot;prime minister&quot;). In 1990, in the first multi-party elections in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] he was elected to the Parliament of the [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], as a candidate of the [[Union of Reform Forces]]. During the [[War in Bosnia]], he served as a representative in the [[National Assembly of the Republika Srpska]]. During that time, he formed the [[Independent Members of Parliament Caucus]] (Клуб независних посланика у Народној Скупштини Републике Српске, ''Klub nezavisnih poslanika u Narodnoj Skupštini Republike Srpske''), which was the only [[political opposition]] the [[Serb Democratic Party]] (Српска демократска странка, ''Srpska demokratska stranka''), which held the absolute majority in the war-time parliament of the Republika Srpska.   The caucus he chaired was to form the core of the [[Party of Independent Social Democrats]] ([[Stranka nezavisnih socijaldemokrata]], or SNSD) in 1996, after the peace was signed as a result of the [[Dayton Agreement]]. He was elected as the first President of SNSD. The party later united with another social-democratic party to form the [[Alliance of Independent Social Democrats]], of which Milorad Dodik is President. In 1997, he was elected into the [[NSRS]].  ==Prime Minister of Republika Srpska (1998-2001, 2005-)== In January 1998, the then [[Politics of Republika Srpska|President of Republika Srpska]] [[Biljana Plavšić]] nominated him for Prime Minister. His government lasted through to January 2001.   During the years in opposition, he concentrated on the strengthening of his political party, which swept the elections in October 2006. During the election campaign, which he led under the slogan &quot;RS, a better part of BiH&quot; he stood opposite to the calls from the other BiH entity (namely from the Bosniak-dominated [[Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (SBiH)) for the abolishment on the Republika Srpska. In response to this, he said he would call for a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska.  == Political Program ==  	 {{main|Alliance of Independent Social Democrats}} Milorad Dodik and the SNSD stand for a [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] that is organized as a decentralized, federal state, with the RS as one federal unit. Dodik claims that [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], as a multiethnic state, needs a sophisticated political system which would distribute political power equally, in order to protect its citizens' rights and prevent any of its [[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|constitutional peoples]] from dominating the other. Dodik further claims that the introduction of a simple pluralist democracy, with the entire country as one electoral unit, would lead to the country being dominated by the Bosniaks, as is currently the case in the [[Croat]]-[[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. He also believes in the economy as the primary driver of the recovery of both the [[Republika Srpska]] and the Federation. He has been often criticized by Bosnian and foreign politicians alike for seeking to make the RS a semi-autonomous state and for seeking to impose many of his views without being willing to compromises.  ==References== {{reflist}}  == References == *[http://www.glassrpske.com/cyrl/?page=&amp;kat=&amp;vijest=15098&amp;PHPSESSID=b6c19ce769905b39c0797d9402222bc4 Интервју: Милорад Додик, премијер РС и предсједник СНСД-а (Глас Српске)] *[http://www.nacional.hr/articles/view/30281 Nacional.hr: Dodik za BiH kao državu multietničkih federalnih jedinica]  ==External links== *[http://www.vladars.net Government of the Republika Srpska] *[http://www.snsd.org SNSD Official Website]  {{Prime Ministers of Republika Srpska}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Dodik, Milorad}} [[Category:1959 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Politicians of Republika Srpska]] [[Category:Serbs]]  [[bs:Milorad Dodik]] [[de:Milorad Dodik]] [[el:Μίλοραντ Ντόντικ]] [[es:Milorad Dodik]] [[fr:Milorad Dodik]] [[hr:Milorad Dodik]] [[he:מילורד דודיק]] [[hu:Milorad Dodik]] [[pl:Milorad Dodik]] [[sq:Milorad Dodik]] [[sr:Милорад Додик]] [[sh:Milorad Dodik]] [[sv:Milorad Dodik]]</text>     </revision>

The failed negotiations over the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] offer to purchase the [[Karl Marx|Marx]]-[[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] Archive and the politically motivated theft from Nicolaevsky's office of [[Leon Trotsky]]'s archives affected him greatly in 1936.

Nicolaevsky is the author of the book &quot;''Karl Marx: Man and Fighter''&quot;, first published in [[German language|German]] in 1933. It was translated into English by [[Otto Mänchen-Helfen]] and published in 1936. Some subsequent English editions restore the notes, appendices, and bibliography omitted from the first English edition.

Born '''Brigitte Deitert''' in [[Essen]], [[Germany]], she studied history in [[Münster]] and Vienna and for a time worked as a [[journalist]] in her native Essen. In 1965 she married the historian and university professor Günther Hamann (1924-1994). The couple had three children. She worked with her husband at the [[University of Vienna]] and in 1978 did her doctoral thesis on the life of [[Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria]], which was published in book form that same year. The success of this first book led to others, notably on [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]], [[Adolf Hitler]], and [[Winifred Wagner]].  Hamann's 1999 book, ''[[Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship]]', examined how societal attitudes at the time shaped Hitler's [[anti-Semitic]] views during his time in Vienna between 1908 and 1913, and the effects of his inordinate fear of both infection and women. Following the publication of ''[[The Hidden Hitler]]'' by the historian and [[University of Bremen]] professor [[Lothar Machtan]], Hamann investigated claims about Hitler's [[homosexual]]ity and appears in the 2004 [[HBO]] [[documentary film]], ''[[Hidden Fuhrer: Debating the Enigma of Hitler's Sexuality]]'', by the American documentarians [[Fenton Bailey]] and [[Randy Barbato]].  In 2005 Hamann released ''Winifred Wagner: A Life at the Heart of Hitler's Bayreuth'', a biography of [[Winifred Wagner]], the [[United Kingdom|British]]-born woman who became a founding member of the [[Nazi Party]] and a close friend of Hitler. The publication earned her &quot;Book of the Year&quot; honors and  ''Opernwelt'' (Operaworld) magazine and &quot;Historical Book of the Year&quot; honors from ''DAMALS'' history magazine. That same year she received the Presseclub Concordia [http://www.concordia.at/content.php?cid=preis&amp;sp=] &quot;Concordia-Preis&quot; in recognition of her work.

It is situated in the [[Hunsrück]] mountains, approx. 25 km south-east of [[Wittlich]] and 35 km east of [[Trier]]. The terrain is rolling hills, superbly organized and maintained stretches of forest interspersed with manicured farmland. Some of the highest (cleanest) air readings in all of Northern Europe have been measured near this area.  Morbach is home (or a nearby base) to museums including the &quot;Deutsches Telefon-Museum&quot; German Telephone Museum, &quot;Archäologiepark Belginum&quot; Archaeology Museum (Morbach-Wederath), and &quot;Hunsrücker Holzmuseum&quot; Wood museum (Morbach-Weiperath). The ruins of the moated castle Zur Baldenau are also nearby.    Morbach also has a distinction as being an enthusiastically fond memory for several hundred United States Air Force Veterans, AKA &quot;AMMO troops&quot;, who worked at nearby WENIGERATH NON-NUCLEAR MUNITIONS STORAGE AREA and lived in the surrounding villages as well as Hahn Air base. Ironically (and perhaps thankfully?), the former &quot;bomb dump&quot;, which ceased operations after the collapse of the USSR, is now dotted with propellers and serves as a wind farm in the war for alternative energy sources.    == Geography == Morbach is situated at a height of 430 to 770 m in the [[Hunsrück]] mountains.

There are many examples where the ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; is used, one being the calculation of the [[nerve conduction velocity]] and another being calculating the contraction velocity of [[muscle fibre]]s. It can also be applied to [[chemical reaction]]s and many other systems.  The ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; is calculated as:  &lt;math&gt;Q_{10}=\left( \frac{R_2}{R_1} \right )^{\left( \frac{10}{T_2-T_1} \right) }&lt;/math&gt;  where  :''R'' is the rate :''T'' is the temperature in [[Celsius]] degrees or [[kelvin]]s.   ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; is a unitless quantity, as it is the factor by which a rate changes, and is a useful way to express the temperature dependence of a process.  For biological systems, the ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; value is generally between 1.5 and 2.5.  == See also == * [[Arrhenius equation]] * [[Arrhenius plot]]  [[Category:Ecological metrics]] [[Category:Chemical kinetics]]</text>     </revision>

Until 1821, the Gulden was a unit of account, worth 5/12 of a [[Conventionsthaler]], used to denominate banknotes but not issued as a coin. It was subdivided into 50 ''Conventionskreuzer'' or 60 ''[[Kreuzer]] landmünze''.  In 1821, the first Gulden coins were issued, equal to the previous Gulden and subdivided into 60 Kreuzer. Between 1829 and 1837, the [[Baden thaler|Thaler]] was the currency of Baden, worth 100 Kreuzer.  In 1837, Baden joined the [[South German Monetary Union]] and readopted the Gulden as its currency, again worth 60 Kreuzer. The new Gulden was equal to the earlier Gulden and was worth four sevenths of a [[Prussian thaler|Prussian Thaler]].  In 1857, the [[Vereinsthaler]] was introduced to Baden but the Gulden, worth four sevenths of a Vereinsthaler, continued to be the chief unit of currency until 1873, when the [[German gold mark|German Mark]] was introduced at a rate of 1 Mark = 35 Kreuzer.  {{Guilder}} {{Money-unit-stub}} {{Germany-hist-stub}} [[category:Baden]] [[Category:Currencies of Germany]] [[Category:Modern obsolete currencies]]</text>     </revision>

For the bus service, see [[TARTA]].'' [[Image:F-14 TARPS.jpg|thumb|F-14 with a TARPS pod mounted]]  [[Image:Logo tarps.gif|thumb]] The '''Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance Pod System''' (TARPS) is a large and sophisticated [[camera]] pod carried by the [[F-14 Tomcat]]. It contains three camera bays with different type [[camera]]s which are pointed down at passing terrain. It was originally designed to provide an interim reconnaissance capability until a dedicated F/A-18 Reconnaissance version could be fielded. However, it was pressed into service upon arrival in the fleet and was still in use up to the end of Tomcat service in 2006.   ==TARPS pod and Tomcat interoperability== [[Image:Crew moves TARPS pod on USS George Washington.jpg|thumb|left|At {{convert|17|ft|m}} and weighing {{convert|1750|lb|abbr=on}}. the TARPS is the largest device hung on a Tomcat.]]  The pod itself is {{convert|17|ft|m}} long, and weighs {{convert|1850|lb|abbr=on}}. and is carried on the starboard side of the tunnel between the engine nacelles. The F-14A and F-14B Tomcats had to be specially modified to carry the TARPS pod which involved routing of control wiring from the rear cockpit and environmental control system (ECS) connections to the pod. Standard allowance was at least three TARPS aircraft per designated squadron (only one per [[airwing]]). All F-14Ds were modified to be TARPS capable, which allowed greater flexibility in scheduling aircraft and conducting maintenance. A control panel is fitted to the rear cockpit and the RIO has total control over pod operation except for a pilot controlled button that can activate cameras as selected by the RIO (but seldom used).  ==Camera bays== [[Image:A crewman looks at TARPS imagery aboard USS George Washington.jpg|thumb|TARPS Intelligence Specialist uses a [[light table]] to analyze film from KS-87 camera.]]  [[Image:Crew inspecting TARPS digital camera.jpg|thumb|left|TARPS personnel attending to forward camera bay.]]  Each of the camera bays was designed to carry different cameras for specific tasks on reconnaissance missions. The forward bay held a 6&quot; focal length serial frame camera (KS-87) on a two position rotating mount which could direct the camera's view straight down or be moved to a 45 degree angle for a forward oblique view.  The second bay or middle bay of the TARPS pod originally held the 9&quot; [[focal length]] KA-99 [[panoramic camera]] which rotated from horizon to horizon and could be used for side oblique photography. Each image in the wide filed of view position produced a 36&quot; negative. The KA-99 could carry up to {{convert|1000|ft|m}} of film that could be exhausted if not managed carefully by the RIO. The third camera bay held an infrared line scanner camera used for night missions or daylight mission traces. All TARPS cameras were monitored by a device call a CIPDU in the tail cone section of the pod that provided camera status to maintenance personnel and during flight provided aircraft position data onto the camera imagery for intel analysis. An electrical umbilical cord connected the pod to the control panel that was positioned on the left side of the rear cockpit. A hose from the ECS from the F-14 cooled/heated the internals of the pod in flight and kept the appropriate humidity levels constant.  [[Image:TARPS pod on skid.jpg|thumb|left|TARPS pod mounted on a skid with TARPS personnel.]]  Tomcat TARPS squadrons were staffed with Navy photographer's mates that maintained the cameras and worked with the carrier to process the imagery. TARPS squadrons also included an extra Intelligence officer and Intelligence Specialists to help plan TARPS missions and exploit the imagery afterwards. The TARPS shop maintained the cameras and removed or loaded the pod when and if needed. Wet [[film processing]] was conducted in a processing room connected to the ship's Intelligence Center (CVIC) where the Intelligence Specialists has a dedicated space with a [[light table]] for analyzing the hundreds of feet of film and exploiting the data.  {{-}} ==TARPS missions== The TARPS pod provided capability for the Tomcat to conduct a variety of Reconnaissance tasking including: * mapping (the Tomcat software was also upgraded to assist with this demanding and painstaking mission) * pre and post strike Bomb Damage Assessment * standoff oblique photography * maritime ship surveillance  ==Upgrades== [[Image:F-14 from VF-102 with TARPS.jpg|thumb|right|[[VF-102]] Tomcat seen carrying a combat TARPS loadout including ECA and ALQ-167.]] Although TARPS was originally planned to be an interim solution, combat experience over Lebanon in 1983 resulted in upgrades to the TARPS camera suite and to the aircraft survivability. Since the KA-99 camera was designed for low-medium altitude missions, the Tomcats were forced to fly as low as {{convert|10000|ft|m}} over active AAA and SAM sites in the Bekaa Valley resulting in 6th Fleet requesting higher altitude cameras such as had been available in the dedicated RECCEE platforms such as the RA-5C, RF-8 and RF-4. As a result, the first set of four KA-93 36&quot; focal length Long Range Optic (LOROP) cameras were shipped to NAS Oceana in the spring of 1984 for deployment with the next Tomcat TARPS squadron. VF-102 conducted an OPEVAL of the cameras enroute to the MED in expectation of flying them over Lebanon, but the crisis had cooled down by then. The cameras then became forward deployed assets and cross-decked between TARPS squadrons. Later, KS-153 LOROP cameras were also procured and also used as forward deployed assets. The KS-87 camera bay was eventually upgraded with a digital sensor so that imagery could be captured onto a [[PCMCIA]] Type II card for debrief, but could also be transmitted as desired by the RIO.  The TARPS mission first exposed the Tomcat to the AAA and SAM threat on a routine basis and spurred upgrades not only to the cameras, but to the aircraft itself. The existing RHAW gear, the ALR-45/50 was vintage Vietnam era and could not keep up with the latest threats of the SA-5 and SA-6, both present in several threat countries in the Mediterranean. As such, TARPS Tomcats were provided with an Expanded Chaff Adapter (ECA) rail that provided 120 extra expendable rounds and another rail that mounted an ALQ-167 jammer. Eventually, the F-14B arrived with the improved ALR-67 RHAW gear capable of keeping pace with the latest threats. Prior to that, some Tomcat squadrons used modified &quot;Fuzz-buster&quot; automotive police [[radar detector]]s mounted ad hoc on the pilot's glare shield to detect threats not handled by the ALR-45/50.  ==Operational history== [[Image:Kynda class cruiser underway.jpg|thumb|right|Classic TARPS image of a Soviet Kynda Class cruiser during the height of the Cold War.]] TARPS was immediately impressed into the Cold War and used for surveillance of Soviet ships at sea and in their anchorages sometimes from over {{convert|1000|mi|km}} distant from patrolling aircraft carriers in the classic cat and mouse tactics of that era.    [[Image:VF-102 F-14 overflies Balzam class.jpg|thumb|left|Watching the watcher. [[VF-102]] TARPS mission to keep an eye on Soviet [[Balzam]] intelligence gathering ship attempting to shadow NATO maneuvers in 1985.]]  TARPS resulted in Tomcats being put in harm's way shortly after it was introduced to the fleet in 1981. VF-102 Tomcats had been inadvertently been fired on by AAA and a single SA-2 SAM over Somalia in April 1983 while conducting peacetime mapping prior to a major exercise. A few months later VF-32 conducted TARPS missions in support of the invasion of Grenada and went on to join VF-43 and VF-31 in flying missions in the Eastern Med where three carriers had gathered to respond to the crisis in Lebanon. Thus, TARPS was responsible for the Tomcat's first sustained combat baptism of fire when the crisis in Lebanon heated up in 1983 requiring daily overflights over hostile AAA and SAMs. During operation El Dorado Canyon in 1986, Libya launched SCUD missiles at a US outpost on an island in the Med and VF-102 flew TARPS to ascertain if there had been any damage.   [[Image:TARPS Desert Storm BDA.jpg|thumb|right|TARPS image of results of Desert Storm F-117 precision bunker busting.]]  Initially, TARPS was not a priority on the Air Tasking Order during Desert Shield/Storm due to availability of strategic assets like the SR-2 and plentiful USAF RF-4 units. However, once Desert Storm started, the demand for realtime intel overwhelmed the other assets and TARPS missions were called upon to meet the demand. Immediately, it became obvious that Tomcats were favored for in country missions over the RF-4 as they required no escort and needed less fuel pre and post mission, which was a real concern at the time. TARPS continued to be utilized post Desert Storm and training was modified to take into account medium altitude tactics such as were flown in Desert Storm. Prior to that, the majority of TARPS missions training missions were low altitude overland and over water navigation and imagery. Only mapping was flown at medium altitudes. TARPS was used routinely in Operation Southern Watch over Iraq and called upon in Bosnia in 1995 and then again over Kosovo in 1999. The advent of [[LANTIRN]] into Tomcat operations provided a useful complement to TARPS. Since both systems need the same real estate in the rear cockpit for sensor operation control panels, they cannot be mounted on the aircraft at the same time, but they can be flown in formation yielding the best of both systems.   TARPS was even used back in the states 1993 when areas of the [[Mississippi River]] flooded.

[[lead(II) fluoride|PbF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] will also fluorinate tellurium to TeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  ==Reactivity== Tellurium tetrafluoride will react with [[water]] or [[silica]] and forms tellurium oxides.  [[Copper]], [[silver]], [[gold]] or [[nickel]] will react with tellurium tetrafluoride at 185 °C.  It does not react with [[platinum]].  It is soluble in [[antimony pentafluoride|SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] and will precipitate out the complex TeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.  ==Properties== Tellurium tetrafluoride melts at 130 °C and decomposes to [[tellurium hexafluoride]] at 194 °C.  In the solid phase it consists of infinite chains of TeF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2/2&lt;/sub&gt; in an octahedral geometry. A lone pair of electrons occupies the sixth position.  ==References== *R.B. King; ''Inorganic Chemistry of Main Group Elements'', VCH Publishers, New York, 1995. *W.C.

The centrepiece is a signboard incorporating signal lights to indicate which workstation has the problem. The alert can be activated manually by a worker using a pullcord or button, or may be activated automatically by the production equipment itself.  The system may include a means to stop production so the issue can be corrected.  Some modern alert systems incorporate audio alarms, text, or other displays.  An Andon system is one of the principal elements of the [[Jidoka]] [[Quality control|quality-control]] method pioneered by Toyota as part of the [[Toyota Production System]] and therefore now part of the [[Lean production|Lean]] approach. It gives the worker the ability to stop production when a defect is found, and immediately call for assistance. Common reasons for manual activation of the Andon are part shortage, defect created or found, tool malfunction, or the existence of a safety problem. Work is stopped until a solution has been found. The alerts may be logged to a database so that they can be studied as part of a continuous-improvement program.  The system typically indicates where the alert was generated, and may also provide a description of the trouble. Modern Andon systems can include text, graphics, or audio elements. Audio alerts may be done with coded tones, music with different tunes corresponding to the various alerts, or pre-recorded verbal messages.  Usage of the word originated within [[Japan]]ese manufacturing companies, and in English is a [[loanword]] from a Japanese word for a [[Traditional lighting equipment of Japan|paper lantern]].  == References ==  Liker, Jeffrey (2004) &quot;The Toyota Way&quot; New York:McGraw Hill ISBN 0-07-139231-9  {{Reflist}}  {{coord|43|46|N|6|47|E|display=title|region:FR_type:adm2nd_source:nlwiki}}  [[Category:Industry]] [[Category:Manufacturing]] [[Category:Lean concepts]] [[Category:Japanese business terms]] [[Category:Quality control]] [[Category:Production and manufacturing]]  [[de:Andon]] [[fr:Andon (gestion)]] [[ja:アンドン]] [[tr:Andon]]</text>     </revision>

It was built in [[1947]] and primarily used by the [[Waterloo Siskins]] junior B [[ice hockey|hockey]] team, although it was also once briefly home to the [[Waterloo Hurricanes]] major junior team in the [[Ontario Hockey League]].   The arena's roof was deemed structurally unsafe in [[1987]] and much of the building was demolished, although the grandstands, ice surface, and front facade and dressing rooms remained. The ice was then enclosed in an inflatable vinyl bubble.  The arena was made redundant by the [[1993]] opening of the [[Waterloo Memorial Recreation Complex|Waterloo Recreation Complex]], although it stayed open until [[2001]], when it was finally torn down.

Two forks rise in the [[Berkeley Hills]], part of the [[California Coast Ranges]], forming a [[confluence]] at the campus of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], then running westward across the city to discharge into [[San Francisco Bay]].  The north fork has also been called &quot;Blackberry Creek&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://strawberrycreek.berkeley.edu/mapsphotos/eastbaycreeks1923map.html  |title=1923 Map of East Bay Creeks and Hayward Fault  |format=map  |publisher=University of California, Berkeley }}&lt;/ref&gt;, a name which has also been applied to another small creek in Berkeley, a portion of which has been [[daylighted]] through Thousand Oaks School Park. The canyon in which the north fork of Strawberry Creek runs is called &quot;Blackberry Canyon&quot;.  Strawberry Creek was the first surface water source for the University and parts of the city of Berkeley.  A reservoir was constructed in the late 19th century in Strawberry Canyon, above the site of [[California Memorial Stadium]].  The reservoir was replaced in the early 20th century by the system of the [[East Bay Municipal Utility District]] whose source [[reservoir]] is located in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].  The creek has been [[culvert]]ed over the years in several places, but has remained open through most of the UC campus, except in the central glade where the two small middle forks were long ago filled in. The south fork of Strawberry Creek has some [[riparian]] [[coast redwood]] groves on the university campus and is also suitable habitat for the [[California slender salamander]] and [[arboreal salamander]].&lt;ref&gt;J.Torrey, A.Kratter et al., ''[[Environmental Impact Report]] for the Business Administration Building, University of California, Berkeley'', Earth Metrics Incorporated, California State Clearinghouse, April, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  Efforts to re-open (&quot;daylight&quot;) the creek throughout its natural course through Berkeley continue, and have so far resulted in the establishment of &quot;Strawberry Creek Park&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/parks/parkspages/StrawberryCreek.html Web Page Moved (or not found) - City of Berkeley, CA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[West Berkeley, Berkeley, California|West Berkeley]] on the site of what used to be a small freight yard of the [[Santa Fe Railway]].  The creek is also open through several private yards in the blocks east of the park, starting just below (west of) Sacramento Street.  Strawberry Creek serves as a significant marker for the movement of the [[Hayward Fault Zone|Hayward Fault]].  The creek is offset at the mouth of Strawberry Canyon, precisely at the locus of Memorial Stadium.  The filled-in middle forks are thought to represent remnants of the former course of the south (main) fork of the creek, which has moved northward by fault action.  In the latter half of the 19th century, a road bridge and a railroad trestle both spanned Strawberry Creek in the [[Downtown Berkeley, California|downtown]] section at what is now the intersection of Shattuck Avenue and Allston Way.  At the mouth of Strawberry Creek where it enters San Francisco Bay, the local indigenous people built up a [[shellmound]].  There was also a small wood of native willows here which was used in the late 19th century as a park.  ==See also== *[[Cerrito Creek]] *[[Codornices Creek]] *[[List of watercourses in the San Francisco Bay Area]] *[[Schoolhouse Creek]] *[[Temescal Creek]]  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==External links== *[http://www.strawberrycreek.org/ Friends of Strawberry Creek] *[http://www.acme.com/jef/creeks/strawberry/ Map and photos of Strawberry Creek] *[http://www.ehs.berkeley.edu/strawberrycreek.html Strawberry Creek] - UC Berkeley Office of Environmental Health and Safety *[http://www.museumca.org/creeks/1140-RescStrawberry.html Strawberry Creek Watershed] - Oakland Museum of California Guide to San Francisco Bay Area Creeks  [[Category:Berkeley, California]] [[Category:Rivers of Alameda County, California]]</text>     </revision>

His studies began with his B.A. from [[University of Chicago]] 1948, M.A. 1950 and his Ph.D. 1962 from [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]].  Married twice, he began teaching at [[San Francisco State University]], the University of Chicago and from 1963 on he taught at Berkeley.  The well-known &quot;Blauner Hypothesis&quot; states that minority groups created by colonization, because it is forced on them, experience a greater degree of racism and discrimination than those created by voluntary immigration.   In his studies, Blauner contrasts the assimilation experiences of Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and Mexican-Americans.

It is located in the southern part of the city.  Ķengarags borders the [[Daugava]] River to the west, the Riga-[[Moscow]] railroad line to the east, [[Rumbula]] to the south, and Krasta Residential Neighborhood to the north.  ==History==  Ķengarags was a location of [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Sword Brothers]] fort, built in [[1208]] [[AD]]. The name &quot;Ķengarags&quot; dates back to late [[16th century AD]] and is a combination of two words &quot;Ķenga&quot;, a name of a farmer who lived in the area, and &quot;rags&quot;, the Latvian word for horn. (The Daugava river makes a horn shaped turn in the Ķengarags area.)  ==Present==  Ķengarags consists of three neighborhoods, known as Ķengarags, Ķengarags-2, and Ķengarags-3 from north (center of Riga) to south (outskirts) respectively.  Each of these parts of Ķengarags consists of both residential and commercial areas.  The main streets of Ķengarags are Lokomotīves iela and Maskavas iela bordering Ķengarags on the east and west respectively.  There are several ways to get to Ķengarags from downtown [[Riga]].  For the points on the east side, the quickest way is the [[elektrichka]], a suburban train service using the Riga-Moscow railroad.  The stations on the railroad line within Ķengarags are Jāņavarti, Daugmale, and Šķirotava.  From Riga Central Train Station by elektrichka it takes about 15 minutes.  An alternative to taking the elektrichka would be either route 7 or 9 [[tram]] which follows Maskavas iela and terminates at the Dole supermarket.  [[Image:kengarags.jpg|thumb|450px|right|Kengarags as seen from the window of the building at 76 Lokomotives iela.  The white 9-story building is 72 Lokomotīves iela and the 5-story building to the right is 78 Lokomotīves iela.]]  The most commonly used method of Ķengarags residents to get to city center is the route 15 [[trolleybus]], which runs through residential neighborhoods and terminates at the southern tip of Ķengarags on Višķu iela.  The residential areas of Ķengarags consist of private houses and apartment buildings, consisting of 4, 5, 9, and 12-story buildings.  Most apartments have [[cable television]] which was installed in the last years of [[Soviet_occupation_of_latvia|Soviet occupation]].  Most of other Riga neighborhoods receive their [[television]] programs through on-roof antennas.  The residents of Ķengarags also benefit from the proximity of Daugava river which is within walking distance for many people.  ==External links== *[http://www.unep.ch/scope/archive/baltic/Background%20report-Latvia_Draft_rev15Jun04.doc Latvian demographics report] *[http://www.agenda21riga.lv/upload_file/300073/RigaCityOfficialPlan.doc Riga development report]  {{Riga's neighbourhoods}}  {{coord missing|Latvia}}  [[Category:Neighbourhoods in Riga]]  [[lv:Ķengarags]] [[ru:Кенгарагс]]</text>     </revision>

The deliberately small program with approximately 150 MBA students admitted per intake, allows the students to reap the advantages of being in an up-close and personal environment. Undergraduate admissions are also selective, competitive, and limited to around +/- 200. Students have ample opportunity to learn from fellow classmates in team assignments and benefit from the diversity of their classmates—there is a wealth of variety, be it in terms of country of origin (roughly a third are international students) or prior educational and professional experience. Students will equally have access to all the resources of a major research university with over 50,000 students.  ==Location &amp; Environment== The Fisher College is located in Columbus, Ohio, the largest city in the state with an estimated 2005 population of 730,657.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2005-01.xls U.S. Census City Population Estimates, 2005 (XLS)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Germany]] on [[12 July]] [[2007]] the [[European Court of Human Rights]] selectively quoted from the ICJ ruling on the ''Bosnian Genocide Case'' to explain that [[ethnic cleansing]] was not enough on its own to establish that a genocide had occurred: {{quotation|The term 'ethnic cleansing' has frequently been employed to refer to the events in Bosnia and Herzegovina which are the subject of this case ... [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] resolution 47/121 referred in its Preamble to 'the abhorrent policy of 'ethnic cleansing', which is a form of genocide', as being carried on in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ... It [''i.e. ethnic cleansing''] can only be a form of genocide within the meaning of the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|Convention]], if it corresponds to or falls within one of the categories of acts prohibited by Article II of the Convention. Neither the intent, as a matter of policy, to render an area “ethnically homogeneous”, nor the operations that may be carried out to implement such policy, can as such be designated as genocide: the intent that characterizes genocide is “to destroy, in whole or in part” a particular group, and deportation or displacement of the members of a group, even if effected by force, is not necessarily equivalent to destruction of that group, nor is such destruction an automatic consequence of the displacement. This is not to say that acts described as 'ethnic cleansing' may never constitute genocide, if they are such as to be characterized as, for example, 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part', contrary to Article II, paragraph (c), of the Convention, provided such action is carried out with the necessary specific intent (''[[dolus specialis]]''), that is to say with a view to the destruction of the group, as distinct from its removal from the region. As the [[ICTY]] has observed, while 'there are obvious similarities between a genocidal policy and the policy commonly known as 'ethnic cleansing' ' (''Krstić,'' IT-98-33-T, Trial Chamber Judgment, 2 August 2001, para. 562), yet '[a] clear distinction must be drawn between physical destruction and mere dissolution of a group. The expulsion of a group or part of a group does not in itself suffice for genocide. ...|ECHR quoting the ICJ&lt;ref&gt;[[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]] [http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/viewhbkm.asp?sessionId=1448788&amp;skin=hudoc-en&amp;action=html&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649&amp;key=63590&amp;highlight= Jorgic v.

Serbia and Montenegro (“Case concerning the application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide”) the International Court of Justice (ICJ) found under the heading of “intent and 'ethnic cleansing'” § 190&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Serbia's violations of its obligations stem not only from the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide but also from two &quot;provisional protective measures&quot; issued by the International Court of Justice in April and September 1993. The then Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was ordered explicitly ''&quot;to do everything in its power to prevent the crimes of genocide and to make sure that such crimes are not committed by military or paramilitary formations operating under its control or with its support.&quot;'' The judges concluded that despite this explicit order, Serbia did nothing in July 1995 to prevent the Srebrenica massacre, although it “should normally have been aware of the serious danger that acts of genocide would be committed.”&lt;ref name=Sense-2007-02-26&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sense-agency.com/en/stream.php?sta=3&amp;pid=9273&amp;kat=3 |publisher=Sense Tribunal |title=Serbia found guilty of failure to prevent and punish genocide. |date=[[February 26]], [[2007]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In reaching this decision, the court referred to the standard set by ''[[Nicaragua v.

Furthermore, according to the ICJ’s judgement ‘it is established by overwhelming evidence that massive killings in specific areas and detention camps throughout the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina were perpetrated during the conflict’ and that ‘the victims were in large majority members of the protected group, the [[Bosniaks]], which suggests that they may have been systematically targeted by the killings.’ Moreover, ‘it has been established by fully conclusive evidence that members of the protected group were systematically victims of massive mistreatment, beatings, rape and torture causing serious bodily and mental harm, during the conflict and, in particular, in the detention camps.’ The Court accepted that these acts, on the part of the Serb forces, had been committed, but that there was inconclusive evidence of the specific intent to destroy the Bosniaks as a group in whole or in part. This includes the period up to 19 May 1992, when [[Bosnian Serb]] forces were under the formal control of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bosnia.org.uk/news/news_body.cfm?newsid=2255 The International Court of Justice and the decriminalisation of genocide] Dr Marko Attila Hoare&lt;/ref&gt;  ICJ President [[Rosalyn Higgins]] noted that while there was substantial evidence of events in Bosnia and Herzegovina that may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity, the Court had no jurisdiction to make findings in that regard, because the case dealt &quot;exclusively with genocide in a limited legal sense and not in the broader sense sometimes given to this term.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/02/26/international/i033600S38.DTL&amp;type=politics|title=Courte: Serbia failed to prevent genocide, UN court rules|date=[[2007-02-26]]|publisher=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sense-2007-02-26/&gt;  The Court further decided that, following Montenegro's declaration of independence in May 2006, Serbia, Serbia and Montenegro's [[successor state|successor]], was the only Respondent party in the case, but that &quot;any responsibility for ''past'' events involved at the relevant time the composite State of Serbia and Montenegro&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/ipresscom/SPEECHES/ispeech_president_higgins_bhy_20070226.htm Statement of the President of the Court]&lt;/ref&gt;  ==See also== *[[Bosnian Genocide]] *[[International Court of Justice]] *[[Srebrenica massacre]]  ==Notes== {{reflist}}  ==References== *[http://www.icj-cij.org/presscom/index.php?pr=1897&amp;pt=1&amp;p1=6&amp;p2=1 ICJ Press Release 2007/8] *[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?sum=667&amp;code=bhy&amp;p1=3&amp;p2=2&amp;case=91&amp;k=f4&amp;p3=5 Summary of the Judgment of 26 February 2007] *[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/91/13685.pdf Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

He was born [[20 December]] [[1839]] in [[Boydton, Virginia]], of [[Scots-Irish]] descent and of scholarship.  He was the son of Professor David Duncan, a native of [[Ireland]], and of [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]].  He settled in Kentucky, then migrated to Virginia.  William graduated from [[Wofford College]] in [[South Carolina]] in 1858 and joined the [[Virginia]] [[Annual Conference]] of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South|M.E. Church, South]] in 1859.  He was a [[Chaplain]] of the [[Army]] of the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War]].  Rev. Duncan transferred to the South Carolina Conference in 1875.  He was a delegate to the First and Second [[Ecumenical]] Methodist Conferences, in 1881 and 1891, respectively.  Prior to his election to the [[Episcopacy]], he served as a [[Pastor]] and an Educator.  Bishop Duncan died [[2 March]] [[1908]] in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]], where he is also buried.  ==Selected Writings== *''J. C.

It is one of California's major [[logging]] and [[sawmill]] operations. The bulk of operations, including the historic [[company town]] of [[Scotia, California]], are located {{convert|28|mi|km}} south of [[Eureka, California|Eureka]] and {{convert|244|mi|km}} north of [[San Francisco]]. Situated on [[US 101]] along the [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]], this large landholder manages timber holdings of nearly 210,000 acres (890 km²)&lt;ref&gt;The [[Press Democrat]], [http://www1.pressdemocrat.com/article/20080116/NEWS/801160343/1033/NEWS01 ''Partnership bidding for Pacific Lumber''] URL retrieved February 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; in the Redwood and Douglas-Fir forests of [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt County]]. It is one of the largest private employers in the region, appropriately known as the [[Redwood Empire]].  In January 2007 the company filed for bankruptcy protection. On [[July 29]], 2008, the &quot;Final Order&quot; from US Bankruptcy attorney, Judge Richard Schmidt, led to the transfer of the assets of the bankrupt PALCO and all its subsidiaries to the [[Mendocino Redwood Company]] and Marathon Structured Finance. After 145 years as PALCO, the new company will be known as the [[Humboldt Redwood Company]]. Though an appeal is pending, it is rare for such a process to be reversed once begun.  ==Overview== The Pacific Lumber Company was started in 1863. It employs over 350 people, but this figure is down from a height of over 1,600 employees at the turn of the millennium.&lt;ref&gt;[[North Coast Journal]], [http://www.northcoastjournal.com/mar98/3-98.health.html ''Don't Call it an HMO''] Url retrieved February 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The company itself is a tourist attraction that once welcomed visitors for a tour of the (now permanently closed) largest [[Redwood]] Mill ever constructed. The quaint town adjacent to the mill is still open to public visits. Pacific Lumber has been at the center of multiple controversies since a hostile takeover by Maxxam, Inc. (of Texas), that was completed in 1986, changing its status from stable employer to one of controversy and finally instability. The controversy is partly a result of a departure from long-standing management practices that ensured sustainability. The company maintains that it is still a sustainable operation, but its policies and practices bear little resemblance to those before 1986. The tale of the company since then is that of constant legal battles, hearings, and lawsuits played out in courts that have involved environmental agencies and organizations as well as the State and Federal governments. 1999 saw the sale of thousands of acres of land to become the Headwaters Forest Reserve. In that agreement, strict rules were put into place requiring the company to manage its holdings under more-restrictive practices. This in part led PALCO to file for bankruptcy in January, 2007. Plans are being considered to bring the company out of bankruptcy. This process, though held in a Texas Bankruptcy Court, has many players, from Wall Street to Humboldt County. Even the Governor of California has written the court stating the importance of this company to all of California.  ==History== ===19th Century=== Pacific Lumber (or PL, as locals have known it for generations) began during the heat of the [[US Civil War]] in 1863 when A. W. McPherson and Henry Wetherbee purchased {{convert|6000|acre|km2}} of timberland on California's Eel River at the rate of $1.25 per acre. Over the ensuing 20 years they added more partners and began significant logging by 1882, at the present main site and town, which was originally known as Forestville. By 1888, the company became the largest in [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt County]], with 300 employees and lumber shipments exceeding 20,000,000 board feet annually. By this time the town name was changed to Scotia and it boasted a [[Western Union]] telegraph station, church, post office, and school.&lt;ref&gt;PALCO, [http://www.palco.com/company.html History: 1863-1889] Url retrieved February 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, the company suffered a major setback as the entire town burned, suffering $400,000 in losses ($8,000,000 in today's terms). The Murphy family, by then the controllers of the company&lt;ref&gt;[[North Coast Journal]], [http://www.northcoastjournal.com/072006/cover0720.html ''Scion''] Url retrieved February 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; chose to rebuild, despite the fact that insurance covered only 25% of losses.  ===20th Century=== Through the rebuilding of San Francisco after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], [[World War I]], and numerous floods on the Eel River, the company came into the modern age. By 1920 the company had 1,500 employees and {{convert|65000|acre|km2}} of timberland. Beginning in the same decade, company management began participating in the preservation movement, primarily as a result of pressure from the [[Save-the-Redwoods League]] in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Save-the-Redwoods League, [http://www.savetheredwoods.org/league/timeline.shtml League] Url retrieved February 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of prior PL holdings including the Rockefeller Forest, the world's largest remaining contiguous [[old growth]] Redwood Forest to survive, now comprise the majority of [[Humboldt Redwoods State Park]]. Further developments included recycling of sawdust into the world's first Presto logs.&lt;ref&gt;PALCO, [http://www.palco.com/company_history_1890.html History: 1890-1949] Url retrieved February 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1931 Stanwood Murphy became president of the company. His unique foresight led to a drastic change in practices from the industry standard of clear cutting to a &quot;selective cut&quot; system of logging. This meant that the company would limit cutting to a maximum of 70 percent of the mature trees in a stand, leaving the younger, most vigorous trees to hold the soil and seed a new generation of forest. He also instituted the concept of &quot;sustainable yield,&quot; which directed planners to never cut more than the company's forests could replace by new growth in any year. These practices were hailed as revolutionary and he and his direct heirs ran the company in this manner for the next 55 years.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, David. 1997. ''The Last Stand: The War between Wall Street and Main Street over California's Ancient Redwoods''. San Francisco. Sierra Club. Pages 16-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1950s, PALCO efforts to make Scotia a comfortable place to live and raise a family provided the following in the company town: affordable employee housing, stores, a school, a hospital, a skating rink, and a theatre. Under the Murphy family, the company implemented an employee pension plan, and provided free life insurance. By 1961, academic scholarships were also provided to students who were children of company employees. In 1975, PALCO was listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;PALCO, [http://www.palco.com/company_history_1950.html History: 1950-1998] Url retrieved February 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  ===Late 20th Century=== &lt;!-- Sadly this is where the story MUST depart the tale (even if only by omission) provided in the official PALCO site for the sake of TRUTH. Jeez enough is enough. --&gt; By the 1980s this huge lumber operation had absolutely no debt. In addition it held a partially diversified portfolio, including a high rise in San Francisco and a lucrative welding operation in the San Francisco Bay Area. A 100 year plan based on sustained yield directed cutting. These long term plans consequently and purposely led to a relatively low profit annually, which unwittingly were about to make the company vulnerable to &quot;new&quot; acquisition practices from Wall Street. The last Murphy to run the then fabled company under these circumstances reflected on what it was like to run such a stable enterprise with sound environmental practices: &quot;We were the good guys. It was fun, it was easy — it was a great life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[North Coast Journal]], [http://www.northcoastjournal.com/072006/cover0720.html Scion: What if Warren Murphy had won the battle for Pacific Lumber Co.?] Url retrieved February 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 30, 1985 the venerable Pacific Lumber Company, having maneuvered through more than a century of business peaks and valleys, was taken over as a result of stock purchases culminating on September 27, 1985.

A Texas bankruptcy court considered reorganization  options early in 2008. On June 6, 2008 the judge preliminarily decided to confirm the [[Mendocino Redwood Company]] option for reorganization and signed the order on July 8, 2008. The Bondholders attempted to appeal but on July 24, the appellate court in Louisiana refused to hear the case. Timber note holders stated that this will mean the Mendocino Redwood Company/ Marathon plan will be able to go forward and many agree that any future court will be unlikely to undo it.&lt;ref&gt;The Eureka Reporter, [http://www.eurekareporter.com/article/080724-appellate-court-rules-in-favor-of-mendocino-redwood-co], URL retrieved July 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  ==Environmental issues== The company has recently considered selling 6,000 acres (24 km²) of mostly old growth [[Sequoia|redwoods]] for $300 million to protect the [[marbled murrelet]], [[spotted owl]], and other [[old growth]] dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Times-Standard]], [http://www.times-standard.com/ci_8137200 ''Bids in for Pacific Lumber's future''] URL retrieved February 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;. As required by regulatory authorities, buffer zones have been further developed around rivers to prevent [[erosion]] and maintain animal habitats, but the Eel River, the regions major waterway, has been considerably damaged as a result of more than 150 years of logging activity, not all of which is the result of PALCO operations.  In 1999 PALCO agreed to American activist [[Julia Butterfly Hill]]'s requests to create a {{convert|3|acre|m2|sing=on}} buffer zone around a 600 year old growth redwood named [[Luna (Redwood Tree)|Luna]] in exchange for leaving the tree, as she had been living in it for just over two years. Though someone vandalized the tree during the process, it survives to the present. In 2003, the Company was sued civilly, by the District Attorney of Humboldt County, for fraud and violations of the California Business and Professions Code. The suit was predicated on the allegation that PALCO had affirmatively represented that its timber operations would have a similar environmental impact across all of its land holdings, when in fact there were wide variances and effects on differing watershed environments. The suit was ultimately dismissed by a California Superior Court Judge, but was later appealed to the California Court of Appeal. In January 2008, the California court of Appeal for the 1st district upheld the trial court's dismissal of the litigation, and the suit is for all practical purposes over.*[http://eurekareporter.com/article/080110-appeal-court-upholds-dismissal-of-fraud-suit-against-palco] During the pendency of this litigation MAXXAM filed for Bankruptcy. Reports indicate that the family that owns the GAP Stores who are already investors in timber lands in Mendocino county, just south of Humboldt county have submitted a proposal to take over PALCO to the Bankruptcy court in Corpus Christie, TX. Environmentalists hailed the move as being a vast improvement on the increased logging approach by Charles Hurwitz and MAXXAM.*[http://www.times-standard.com//ci_7786338?IADID=Search-www.times-standard.com-www.times-standard.com]  ==Notes== &lt;{{reflist}}  ==References== *The Last Stand: The War between Wall Street and Main Street over California's Ancient Redwoods.

Other buildings in use on the campus are the &quot;Academy&quot; and the North Kansas City Public Library and Media Center. Northtown prides itself on its unique opportunity both as one of the only local schools to have an open campus but also as the only school in the area to allow open lunch to all students.   == Role in History == The stone wall around the [[football field]] was created as a work project during the [[Great Depression]]. It has been ranked the Most Interesting High School [[American football|Football]] Field in the [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|Kansas City]] area by the ''[[The Kansas City Star|Kansas City Star]],'' and has been used for local commercials, including [[Metro Sports]].  ===Sports=== Competitive Teams Include:  '''Men's and Women's teams''' *[[Soccer]] *[[Swimming]] and [[Diving]] *[[Tennis]] *[[Golf]] *[[Track and Field]] *[[Cross country running|Cross Country]]  '''Men's only''' *[[Baseball]] *[[Football]] *[[Scholastic wrestling|Wrestling]]  '''Women's only''' *[[Softball]] *[[Cheerleading]] *[[Dance|Pom/Dance Squad]]  ===Clubs=== *[[Student Council]] *Northtown [[Theatre]] Association  *[[Quizbowl]] *Science Olympiad *Robotics Club *Foreign Language Club ([[German language|German]] Club, [[French language|French]] Club, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] Club) *''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' Fan Club  *Frisbee Golf Club *Northtown [[Debate|Forensics]] League  *National Honors Society  *[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Hornets Club *Young [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] Club *American Field Service *Marching band *Concert band *Freshman Orchestra *Varsity Orchestra *Color Guard  == In Popular Culture == In 2006 Marty Wolff, one of the school's theater teachers was chosen to represent the state of Missouri on the [[NBC]] weight-loss game show [[The Biggest Loser (Season 3)|The Biggest Loser]].

At one point, he came to the school with a film crew to film a segment for the show involving a group of his students. After the show, he quit his teaching position at the school, moving to [[Chicago]].  == Related Sites == * [http://www.nkcsd.k12.mo.us/nkhs/ School's Webpage] * [http://www.nkcsd.k12.mo.us/ District's Webpage]  [[Category:High schools in Missouri]] [[Category:Educational institutions established in 1925]]</text>     </revision>

The League had its primary focus on unified defense, and secondarily on trade, and may have been linked by ethnic bonds (the [[Chrysaorians]]).  It had an assembly and financial institutions, and a form of reciprocal citizenship whereby a citizen of a member city was entitled to certain rights and privileges in any other member city.  The capital of the League was [[Chrysaorium]] where the assembly met.  [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/gazetteer/0111.html]   Other member cities included: [[Alabanda]] (renamed ''Antiochia of the Chrysaorians''), [[Alinda]], [[Amyzon]], [[Ceramus]], [[Mylasa]], [[Kaunos|Peræa Rhodiorum]], [[Stratonikeia|Stratonicea]], [[Thera (Caria)|Thera]].  For periods of time, some of the member cities were subject to [[Rhodes]].  ==References==  * J.

In 1978, at 24 years of age, Hoeger earned his [[Ed.D.]] in exercise physiology, also from [[Brigham Young University]].  He then taught at the [[University of the Andes in Merida, Venezuela]] from 1978 to 1982; the [[University of Texas of the Permian Basin]] in [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]] from 1983 to 1986, and served as Technical Director of Fitness Monitoring in [[Rolling Meadows, Illinois]] from 1982 to 1983.  He joined Boise State University in 1986.  He has authored 44 editions of nine fitness &amp; wellness college textbooks. Since 1990, he has been the most widely read author in this field among colleges and universities in the United States.  ==Luge career== Competing in two [[Winter Olympics]], Hoeger earned his best finish of 32nd in the men's singles event at [[Turin]] in [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006]]. At 52, he represented his home country of Venezuela at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]]. As their only athlete at the games, he carried their flag at the [[2006 Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony#Parade of Nations|Parade of Nations]].  He was the oldest actual competitor at these games. At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, competing alongside his son Christopher, they became the only father and son to ever compete in the same event in the Winter Olympic Games.  Hoeger's best finish at the [[FIL World Luge Championships]] was 38th in the men's singles event at [[Nagano]] in [[FIL World Luge Championships 2004|2004]].  ==Personal life== Hoeger was born and raised in the city of Merida, Venezuela. His Olympic dream started during the 1968 Summer Olympic Games in Mexico City. In 1970 at the age of 16, he made the Venezuelan National Gymnastics team and was undefeated as national all-around champion until he retired in 1976. He won 34 of 36 individual national titles during these six years. In the fall of 1970, he was recruited by Brigham Young University and competed there for four years. His dream was to compete in the [[1972 Munich]] or the [[1976 Montreal]] Summer Olympic Games.  As the only athlete with a chance to qualify for his native Venezuela, he was never given the opportunity to try out for the games.  He waited 34 years to fulfill his dream of competing in the Olympic Games. Hoeger is a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. He is married with five children.  ==References== *[http://www.todor66.com/olim/2002w/Luge_Men_Singles.html 2002 luge men's singles results] *[http://www.todor66.com/olim/2006w/Luge_Men_Singles.html 2006 luge men's singles results] *[http://kinesiology.boisestate.edu/faculty/hoeger.htm Boise State University faculty profile] *[http://www.fil-luge.org/filext/athlet/erfolge_en.asp?p_id=100179 FIL-Luge profile] *[http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,40-1-3324-18,00.html Kartford, Brittany. &quot;Winning at Luging&quot; from the Latter-Day Saints] *[http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/sports/other_sports/13852420.htm ''Lexington Herald Leader'' article on Hoeger] *[http://www.torino2006.org/ENG/IDF/ATH/101497.html Torino 2006 profile]  {{BD|1953||Hoeger, Werner}} [[Category:American academics]] [[Category:Boise State University faculty]] [[Category:Brigham Young University alumni]] [[Category:Lugers at the 2002 Winter Olympics]] [[Category:Lugers at the 2006 Winter Olympics]] [[Category:Olympic lugers of Venezuela]] [[Category:People from Idaho]] [[Category:People from Texas]] [[Category:People from Provo, Utah]] [[Category:University of the Andes faculty]] [[Category:University of Texas of the Permian Basin faculty]] [[Category:Venezuelan Latter Day Saints]] [[Category:Venezuelan lugers]]   {{Luge-bio-stub}} {{Venezuela-sport-bio-stub}}  [[de:Werner Hoeger]]</text>     </revision>

Manning]], Chief [[Forester]] of British Columbia from 1936 - 1941. Mr. Manning was killed in an airplane accident in 1941. During his time as Chief Forester he was very instrumental in developing the idea of setting land aside for future generations to enjoy.  The terrain in the park varies from wet coastal rain forests, to jagged snow-capped peaks, alpine meadows filled with wildflowers, to a chain of small lakes, and broad river beds along the valley floors. A network of trails criss-crosses the park. The park is best known for its magnificent midsummer displays of subalpine flowers, but there are other flora such as at Rhododendron Flats, near the park's western entrance, which has a substantial colony of pinkish-red rhododendrons, a protected indigenous species that blooms in early to mid-June. Some of the less common species the park aims to protect are the [[Mountain Beaver]], [[Wolverine]] and the [[Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel|Cascade Golden-Mantled Ground Squirrel]]. [[Image:HikingIntoMeadow 1150H.jpg|thumbnail|200px|left|Hiking in the alpine in E. C. Manning Provincial Park]]  ==Recreation== The park has a large variety of walking and hiking trails which range anywhere from a 15 minute walk to a 5 or 6 day hike. In the winter it is a popular destination for downhill and [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country]] skiers.  The park is also the northern terminus of the [[Pacific Crest Trail]].  ==Location== The park stretches for 58 [[kilometres|km]] from portal to portal. The western portal is 26 km east of [[Hope, British Columbia]] and the eastern portal is 52 km west of [[Princeton, British Columbia]]. The core area of the park is located 68 km east of Hope and 68 km west of Princeton and is less than 5km from the US border. ==See also== *[[Cathedral Provincial Park and Protected Area]] *[[North Cascades National Park]] *[[Pasayten Wilderness]]  ==External links== *[http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/manning.html Information] *[http://www.manningpark.com Manning Park Resort Website] *[http://www.johnharveyphoto.com/ManningCamping/index.html Camping, hiking and canoeing in Manning Provincial Park]  [[Category:Fraser Valley Regional District, British Columbia]] [[Category:Provincial Parks of British Columbia]] [[Category:Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen, British Columbia]] [[Category:Cascade Range]]  {{BritishColumbia-park-stub}}  [[de:Manning Provincial Park]]</text>     </revision>

His changes were resisted by those who had been editing the article for some time, as they were considered to be attempts to insert and present fringe scholarship as mainstream views.  He sometimes edited as {{User|64.121.40.153}}, and acknowledged those edits as his, when he inadvertently got logged out.  After Givanni33 had met with some resistance, {{User|BelindaGong}} turned up to support him. She sometimes edited from an IP address &amp;ndash; {{User|38.114.145.148}}, which she agreed was probably hers. Her very first edits both as 38.114.145.148 and as BelindaGong were reverts to Giovanni's version.  They both reverted aggressively, while lecturing their ofor reverting them.  They very quickly violated 3RR, but were not reported as they were new (even though they had been warned gently but frequently of the rule before the actual violations occurred).  They continued to revert unrepentantly, and seemed to take advantage of the fact that the &quot;old&quot; editors were reluctant to report them, or to go beyond three reverts themselves. Finally, after a long period of gross violations from both of them (on one occasion, Giovanni reverted an article 11 times in about eighteen and a half hours, despite being asked repeatedly to stop), they were both blocked.  See the reports [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RRArchive10#User:Giovanni33_combined_with_User:64.121.40.15327_noticeboard/3RRArchive10#User:BelindaGong|here]] and [[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RRArchive10#User:Giovanni33_combined_with_User:64.121.40.153|here]].  Since then they have been careful, and have not violated 3RR, although they have, on numerous occasions, taken six reverts between them in a 24-hour period.  They have also voted together. Belinda often shows up to revert just as Giovanni has used up his three reverts. In fact, as I write these words, she's doing it right now at [[Christianity]].  The [[WP:RFCU]] results came in on Saturday. [[User:Giovanni33]] is [[User:BelindaGong]]. They had constantly denied this, and had put up an elaborate pretence of not knowing each other (see their talk pages), while suggesting that User:Str1977 and User:KHM03 were sockpuppets, and that I was a meatpuppet for Str1977.  I would appreciate some advice on what I should do now. I seem to recall that in the past, admins have blocked indefinitely an account that was sockpuppeting to get round the rules, and have also blocked the main account for a period. In my view, Giovanni is the ''real'' account holder, as Belinda nearly always just reverts to his version, whereas he posts long messages to the talk pages in order to justify his edits (though he then insits on posting his extremely controvesial edits even if he hasn't achieved any kind of agreement.  I know I can't block people I'm in dispute with. Does that mean that I shouldn't block Giovanni or Belinda, since I have opposed their edits? Is an indefinite block on Belinda justified?  Advice would be welcome. [[User:Musical Linguist|AnnH]] [[User talk:Musical Linguist|&lt;sup&gt;(talk)&lt;/sup&gt;]] 04:11, 14 February 2006 (UTC)  :You're right that you shouldn't block them, as that would be an abuse of your administrator privileges.  But it sounds like they are definitely violating the spirit of 3RR, which is an abuse of having a second account.  Coming here and telling the story was the right thing to do, as it sounds like this is a problem that needs to be addressed.  I don't have time right now to investigate the specifics and engage in the appropriate dialogue before considering a block (which may well be necessary) but I'm sure some other admin will do so.  [[User:Moink|moink]] 06:04, 14 February 2006 (UTC)  :I would suggest that you submit a [[WP:RCU]] to see if they are sock puppets of each other.  If they are, block both for 3RR violations.  --[[User:Nlu|Nlu]] ([[User talk:Nlu|talk]]) 06:08, 14 February 2006 (UTC) ::As indicated above, she already has, and they are. -[[User:GTBacchus|GTBacchus]]&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:GTBacchus|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 06:18, 14 February 2006 (UTC)  :Looks like [[User:MONGO]] has blocked both for 24 hours, an appropriate remedy for the apparent violation.  I'm sure many will be keeping an eye on them after the block expires.  Good job keeping your cool, Ann.  [[User:Moink|moink]] 06:27, 14 February 2006 (UTC)  ::{{user|Kecik}} has shown up to continue the edit war.  [[User:Jkelly|Jkelly]] 20:28, 14 February 2006 (UTC)  I think the article [[Christianity]] could benefit from mediation.  I'm surprised to see very few citations.  In controversial pages like this, people have to stop presenting their own views and do serious scholarship.  That means presenting a multitude of views and documenting who says what.  I know next to nothing about the subject (I'm an ethnically Jewish agnostic raised as an atheist), but reading the article and the discussion I don't understand the difference between the views.  Assuming one is mainstream and the other is more of a fringe view, they should both be presented so that someone like me understands the different views and can recognize which are mainstream and what the controversy is about.  I don't know if the parties in this debate can accomplish this without moderation.  I'd also try to get everyone to agree to a ONE REVERT policy. If there is a clear controversy, three reverts just waste everyone's time.  If people can't behave civilly and work together, perhaps the page needs to be protected and all edits happen by agreement on the talk page.  If you all worked together you could probably create a great article. Good luck. -- [[User:SamuelWantman|Samuel Wantman]] 06:50, 14 February 2006 (UTC) :I second this notion. Infact my proposal has been that no one revert anothers work without at least coming to the talk page first. Making the talk page mandatory before making a revert would do a lot to help.[[User:Giovanni33|Giovanni33]] 10:17, 18 February 2006 (UTC)  This is why I could never run a stable of sockpuppets: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGiovanni33&amp;diff=39658698&amp;oldid=39658454]  It's just too easy to get confused. I believe both of these, as well as {{vandal|BelindaGong}}, are currently blocked for using puppets to avoid the three-revert rule. [[User:Tom harrison|Tom Harrison]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Tom harrison|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:18, 15 February 2006 (UTC) :Again, I have no socketpuppets, and I'm willing to prove beyond any reasonable doubt for anyone would would like to take me up on the offer. I will trust any arbcom admin with my the personal ID's. [[User:Giovanni33|Giovanni33]] 10:17, 18 February 2006 (UTC)  :[[User:FionaS]] may be an additional sock.  [[User:KHM03|KHM03]] 02:13, 16 February 2006 (UTC) ::I think FionaS did admit to being a sock infact. But, not my sock. She stated that she wanted to speak out but not be targed for harassment in her main account. This person may be an established older user. There are legitimate reasons for somoene to have a sock, and it appears Fiona made a good argument for why she adopted this sock. I also note she did not do any reverts. That editors feel they must hide inorder to express themselves is indicative of the chilling atmosphere that results when those with a contrary POV are bullied. [[User:Giovanni33|Giovanni33]] 10:17, 18 February 2006 (UTC)  As I'm rushing out now, and have no time to provide an update, perhaps some not-too-busy admin might take a look [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_CheckUser#208.54.15.129_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29.2C_MikaM_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29.2C_69.107.21.3_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29.2C_Freethinker99_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29.2C_and_Kecik_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29|here]] and [[Talk:Christianity#Dirty_sock_issues|here]] and give some advice. There's quite a history of redlinked user names appearing, agreeing with Giovanni, reverting to his version, voting for whatever he votes for, etc. And one of them accidentally signed his own signature for something that Giovanni33 was answering. Then he logged in as Giovanni, and changed the signature. Comments please? Thanks. [[User:Musical Linguist|AnnH]] [[User talk:Musical Linguist|&lt;sup&gt;(talk)&lt;/sup&gt;]] 13:26, 16 February 2006 (UTC)  :*Comment:  I admit I edit warred in the very beggining. I have stopped. I noticed you keep bringing up my past 3RR violations to paint me as an aggressive edit warrior, but the truth is otherwise. I extensively used the talk pages to work for and infact build real consensus. I pleaded that no one reverts to undo anyother editors work (except for vandalism) without first at least going to the talk page. My idea to stop edit warring was ignored. Still, I learned that simply winning an argument by providing references while the side failed to and went silent, did not entitle me to edit war in vio of the policy; being right is no excuse. So I stopped. I am reasonable and I have been convinced when wrong. I can be swayed, but with reason, and evidence to support the claims. After my first block, I never violated the 3RR again. But I continued try to find out what the objections were and have them substantiated, using reasoned arguments, and sources. This apparently emboldened other users (my theory) who started to show up, agree with me and help me out--but no different than the tag teaming you have enjoyed with your confidants in pursuing for your POV. (another theory is that they are real sockets created to make it look as if they were my sockets to use as a diversion away from edits work). But, I assume good faith. When the threat of possible equality for a secular POV encroached, in part by my winning over the moderate voices, the aggressive attacks of socket puppet accusations started, and expanded so that anyone who agreed with me was automatically suspect; to assume bad faith was made the norm and civility was thrown out. That Belinda proved to be my wife (a fact I felt I had a right to keep private) was seized on as excuse to avoid even trying to work on the article to address contentious points. Now it's locked. Temporarily this might not be bad if it forces others to go to the talk page to address the issue.   ::You will forgive me, AnnH, if I think you have utterly failed not to [[WP:BITE|bite]] newcomers. Freethinker was a newcomer, yet as soon as he explained his relation to me he was attacked, blocked, and his page defaced with a socket puppet label. This is the opposite of assuming good faith. Now he doesn't want to come back. Infact you called him a &quot;meatpuppet&quot; outright, after he explained his connection to me. He was new and wanted to help with the POV disputes. I mentioned before to you that the Wiki policy states, ''&quot;Do not call these users &quot;meatpuppets&quot;; be civil.&quot;'' It should be reasonable to understand (yet you said you can't understand it after it was explained to you) The only other time I used another account was once when I was at a friend's house, to introduce him to Wikipedia (I think getting a more diverse body of pov's is healthy, not bad), and I used his account only to respond to a question on my talk page. This was all open and disclosed by me. Its lot logical to assume that this is an attempt by me to use a socketpuppet, esp. when  I use his PC and even sign his name to my message (which I corrected, to my name when I know full well about the usercheck abilities. Yet, despite this you keep spreading a negative bad faith interpretation that assumes a negative intenion on my part. I also will say that as a result he was blocked, and I was blocked for an additional 48 hours (72 in total for having my wife edit and inviting a friend). I don't protest this, even though I'm innocent of any sockepuppetry, and did not violate 3RR or any rule. What I do protest in the strongest way possible is the continued distruption with constant socketpuppet allegations of me and others based on allegations and variations of different half-truths that insult, disrupt, and distract from honest editing.   ::I think the Christianity article's problems, in part, stems from an ideological rigidity kept in tact by a dominance of multiple users sharing the same basic POV. Apparently any new comer doesn’t meet groupthink standards is bullied into conformity, silence, or expulsion. I felt I was. You will recall that user Sophia stated she felt bullied and ganged up on, when she first joined, that it was scary. Others stated similar sentiments. The very fact of the nature of maintaining one POV means that newcomers who do not fit will get the bite experience. Most will probably leave. In this sense the article space acts like just like institution, it’s self-selecting.   ::The socket puppet allegations have not stopped but are now being pushed agressively despite the fact that the checks have cleared me and the others. This now objectively serve as a tool keep the status quo by attack users integrity instead of their arguments. I see it as intimidation and disruption with the aim of getting me permanently banned. In my forced wiki-break (although I've been editing in the other wiki language sites) I've also had a chance to read a lot of messages so I'm confident I know whats going on, what you have been saying, and others, and can easily see what the motivations and goals are not in good faith. You want me gone for good. I'm sorry if I'm not going to violate any rules to make that easy. Belinda is not my socketpuppet, and I can prove she is my wife. That should restore my credibility and put to rest this modern day inquisition. I’m willing to forgive and continue assuming good faith as I realize that is not a luxury but a necessity in order to focus on the collaborative effort we are all supposed to be part of.  ::Despite my concilliatory and amicable disposition, and the fact that I've pleaded to to focused on my arguments to improve the Christianity article, the continued allegations of socketpuppetry by those I've had Pov diputes with, continue unabated. I think, are being done in bad faith being pushed by a handful of edit warriors as a result of the POV differences. The speculations continue to disrupt good faith discussions and turn them into personal attacks. It has gotten so bad that I think it borders on harassment. Sadly, I've been convinced that AnnH has been making this her mission, expanding it to anyone whose agreed with me, is taking the form of an ugly inquisition; even an older valued editor has left in protest describing it with this kind of language.  AnnH continues to lead this attack spreading bad faith assumptions, making interpretations and speculations to cast the worst possible light over me and others, over and over in different places. I have had a hard time even keeping up with trying to defend myself over the many one-sided half-truths being spread. Keeping my marriage private was my right; that I chose to not share this fact is irrelevant to the fact that she is my wife and hence not a sockpuppet, which is all that should matter (I've offered to prove it-- if any arbcom admin is interested, by sending you our respective ID's for Giovanni and Belinda Gong, our real names). I disclosed this after a usercheck showed our connection to offer a valid explanation for the appearance of sockepuppetry. We were both blocked.  Due to the POV dispute I've had with AnnH and a couple others, they are now taking advantage of this to continue what is essential a personal attack, including anyone else who has agreed with my pov. Even after a usercheck has cleared them and myself, all kinds of accusatory speculations continue unabated. The result is in effect to disrupt constructive edit work to improve the substance of articles. This is indecent, counter-productive, and harassment. The role that AnnH describes of my wife, also exactly matches her own role in pushing for her own Pov with user Str1977; they have use up 3reverts each between each other, and AnnH has even accidentally gone over 3rv's in a 3RR vio herself. AnnH says that was an accident and I believe her. She is careful to follow the letter of the rules, although this McCarthy like witch-hunt is certainly violating the spirit of several other equally important wiki rules and principals. I ask her to stop this, if not for me then for the good of Wikipedia as it's inimical to the good the project. Thanks for reading.

I warned him for a series of edits in which he created a redirect from 'Kim Il Sung City' (in Korean) to [[Seoul]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=%EA%B9%80%EC%9D%BC%EC%84%B1_%EC%8B%9C&amp;timestamp=20060201225735] and then asked on the Refdesk what the redirect meant [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Miscellaneous&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=39840350].  He subsequently removed his signature from his question, then deleted the question, then re-added it from an IP address.

He's been blocked twice this month (the second time, I'm convinced he used [[User:Zeo6]] as a sock puppet account to evade the block - please see my rationale at [[User talk:Zeo6]]). Since the second block expired, he's persisted in uploading images without source details (despite 38 previous missing source/licensing reminders and three messages from me in which I've offered to help him if he doesn't understand how to deal with source/licensing tags), he has blanked a redirect page and he has removed an AfD tag from a page he created - I left a &quot;final warning&quot; after that one.  Since the final warning he has uploaded images which he tagged as public domain because he &quot;couldn't find anything that matched and that happened to be the closest [he] could find&quot;. As a result, I left a long-ish comment [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Rick_lay95#Image:PRDFgroup.jpg_and_Image:PRTgroup.jpg here], warning him that he needed to start heeding copyright issues and to follow policies.

However, I feel a block (probably longer than the 24hr/48hr blocks he's already had this month) is in order - please could another admin review this case and take appropriate action (either issuing a block or telling me to cool down if I'm over-reacting!).

Sometimes it is not a direct block of the IP address, but a [[Wikipedia:Autoblock]] that causes it. Generally, the problem corrects itself quickly, as the user is moved onto a new, unblocked IP just as quickly as he or she was moved on to the blocked one. It's inconvenient, but barring all users demanding static IPs from their ISPs, there is nothing that can be done. In future, if you have this problem, you can email the administrator who placed the block, or add {{tl|Unblock}} to your talk page. Make sure to say you believe it is not an actual block of your account, but a block of the IP you are on, and give that IP address (it will appear in the block message you see). An administrator can do a &quot;hard unblock&quot; (acutally input that IP into the unblock page) and force an unblock of that IP, whether the initial block was an actual IP block or an autoblock. &lt;font color=#696969&gt;[[User:Essjay|Essjay]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Essjay|''Talk'']] • [[User:Essjay/Contact|''Contact'']]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 23:35, 18 February 2006 (UTC) ::You can always check that your username hasn't been blocked at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:ExampleUser block log].

The boxes aren't doing anything and do not present an ugrent problem.   *Editors and admins are doing things, and it is the continued posturing on both sides that is the urgent problem.  '''Possible classes of userboxes, with totally made up percentages''' *Marginally useful (5%) **These are the language, browser, etc boxes.  Convert these into categories.  The users who have are likely to be amenable to reason, and there is no rush. *Useless but not mostly harmless (90%) **&quot;This user is made of meat&quot; ''et alii''.  These are mulitplying because they are easy, and the &quot;pick lists&quot; of userboxes make this worse.  Slow the creation of these and eventually eliminate them. *Potentially harmful (5%) **Divisive user boxes (.1%) - These are mostly either simply jokes in poor taste like the original &quot;This user is a pedophile&quot; or trolling like the &quot;This user had been attracted to females under 16 while not under 16&quot;   **Polemic user boxes (4.9%) - These are the thorniest issue.  &quot;User dislikes George Bush&quot;    **These need to be removed, we all agree on that.  The only question is how and how soon.  '''What's the harm again?''' *All problems arise from the ''editor's behavior'' and not the user boxes.   *The mostly harmless 90% are often used by the newest members of the community.  Not a ''huge'' problem, and it's good if people have fun and learn some wikimarkup.  But when the first edits they make (or the first 75) are hanging curtains on a user page, it's easy to lose sight of the &quot;encyclopedia first&quot; concept.   **First get rid of the pick-lists, then slowly &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and deleted the existing templates while explaining nicely the reasons why.  Again there is no rush.  This can almost certainly be done with simple talking, and work on the wikiproject.  I've dipped my toe in here, and the response has mostly been &quot;Sure, I thought it was funny, but since you asked nicely I'll take it down.&quot; **&lt;font font color = &quot;blue&quot;&gt;This is not an urgent problem, and is not amenable to a quick fix.&lt;/font&gt; *Divisive boxes - are actually few and far between.   **In some cases it's just stupidity, and a simple explanantion is all that's required.  More often it's trying to get a rise, and should be treated as such.  When SPUI pops a &quot;pseudo-pedo&quot; userbox on his page, deleting the box isn't going to do anything. Remember ''We don't feed trolls.''  Editing is always a better way to solve a problem than use of sysop powers.  Edit troll boxes into something mild.  If someone wants to edit war, 3RR blocks are uncontroversial. **&lt;font font color = &quot;blue&quot;&gt;This is an urgent problem only if we make it so, but ''is'' amenable to a quick fix.&lt;/font&gt;  *Polemic boxes - these are the actual problem.  These range from the mild &quot;This user doesn't have a problem with the UN but just thinks they are useless&quot; to the shocking &quot;This user supports Hamas' campaign of suicide bombing&quot;. **These may also be used for vote stacking.  I've only seen one instance of it, but there could be more. No images in templates, full stop, would solve half this problem.  This is, I believe, also supported by the developers.  Using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; would solve the other half.  Talking about other ways to use an image-free, substituted template for vote stacking might be spilling the beans. **&lt;font font color = &quot;blue&quot;&gt;This is not an urgent problem, but ''is'' amenable to a quick fix.&lt;/font&gt; **The big problem is that people feel like they that they ''ought'' to be able to voice some opinions about Geogre or somesuch.  And to some small degree, they should.  We're humans, we have opinons. ***When we use admin powers to stop people from expressing their opinon (or some fascile mass-produced group-think opinon as the case may be) they are going to be upset.  They can't restore things, and if they re-create them they just get deleted again.  So now DRV and TfD are totally constipated because people feel like they need to have their &quot;voice heard&quot;.  Of course that's bollocks, there's no freedom of speech here, only the freedom to contribute. ***Deleting fairly mild &quot;Anti-pope&quot; user boxes as if they were &quot;This user hates jews&quot; is troll-baiting.  As long as we keep jamming people down, they are going to keep popping back up in other places.  The irony of deleting an anti-George bush template is that it's only going to convert another mild-mannered editor into a &quot;template freedom fighter&quot;. **&lt;font font color = &quot;blue&quot;&gt;This is urgent problem, but is not amenable to a quick fix.  But it ''can'' be made less urgent. &lt;/font&gt;  '''A proposed solutions''' *Stop deleting boxes for reasons of &quot;controversy&quot; or &quot;trolling&quot;.  Someone must stop shooting first, and we're meant to be the sensible ones. *Use redirecting and editing to fix problem boxes.  User 3RR if required.  Stop playing with the sysop buttons, you'll go blind. *Get some less inflammitory members of our community to engage the template warriors in dialog.  Work on the wikiproject. *Have a little more patience, use care, and remember that everyone thinks they are right.  :I have to agree with Aaron. What we must remember here is that the majority of users with these boxes probably won't have any knowledge of this debate, or the damage the boxes can cause. Imagine an editor who doesn't read AN, or TFD or anything like that, but sticks to a few articles about his favourite subject, whatever that may be. Upon going to the user page of another editor, he finds a &quot;This user does not support George Bush&quot; box, or whatever, and thinks &quot;hey, I like that&quot;, sticks it on his page and thinks nothing more of it. If he sees one day that it's been deleted or removed from his page, can you really be surprised when he wonders why or gets a little annoyed? We need to explain to users like him why these boxes are such a big deal. [[User:Raven4x4x|Raven4x4x]] 02:03, 17 February 2006 (UTC)  :I highly 2nd this suggestion above.  I'd ask that it be put onto a separate page somewhere, so it can be referred to.  This is really sensible, and right. We do need to get rid of these things, but we also need to do it in a way that adds, rather than splits, the community.  [[User:134.10.12.31|134.10.12.31]] 01:58, 18 February 2006 (UTC) ([[User:JesseW/not logged in]])  Not doing something about polemical userbxxes is not an option.  They have been used in several instances of attempted vote stacking, they are divisive because they inject external political advocacy into Wikipedia, they give people the wrong idea about what Wikipedia is for and what a user page is for.  They are harmful.  And the boss wants them gone.  Speedy deletion has been very successful, and the new criterion has gained wide acceptance among acculturated Wikipedians.  It's not as if we're doing this without explaining what is happening, and it's not as if a huge number of editors were using these boxes--a large-scale survey I did found that only around 10% of all active editors on my watchlist actually had polemical userboxes.  But still the number of useroxes grows. Up from 3500 on January 4 to 5800 when I checked again on February 14.  The page of political belief-based userboxes is up from 45 in January to 150 in February.  A relatively small number of editors are producing userboxes in any great numbers, and quite a few of them those already known as trouble-makers on these pages.  Names like Mistress Selina Kyle (92 boxes), and Bourbons3 and his sock Dussst (a total of 174 boxes across both incarnations).  People with no interest in editing the encyclopedia become Userbox producers and advocates--[[User:Vargher]], on [[WP:DRV]], said &quot;Jimbo Wales is the founder of Wikipedia, but WE are the community. WE build the encyclopedia, so WE decide.&quot;  A quick check showed that Vargher had produced a grand total of five article edits and seven talk page comments in his three weeks on Wikipedia, during which time he had managed to make SIXTY edits to his user page.  Bourbons3, in addition to his prolific userbox creation activities, made a habit of uploading pictures he obviously did not own with deliberately falsified upload summaries.   So its utter nonsense to say that Wikipedia isn't being damaged.  It's pie-in-the-sky to imagine that we can get anywhere by talking to the kind of people who come to Wikipedia to produce this trash.  And its insulting to equate those, some of us senior Wikipedians with an edit count that would make your eyes water, destroying this damaging rubbish, with those producing it and frankly little else on Wikipedia. --[[User talk:Tony Sidaway|Tony Sidaway]] 07:42, 17 February 2006 (UTC)  :Yes, editing articles is important. People shouldn't be on Wikipedia just to fight about userboxes.

People like Vargher, for instance, demonstrate [[User:Deathphoenix/Deathphoenix's Law|my law]]: that the number of opinion-expressing userboxes is inversely proportional with number of edits that user makes to the main articlespace. I won't say that I'm much better, because I'm just a lightweight editor, but the amount of time and serverspace that these relatively new users spend on Wikipedia could be better used for editing articles. If they want to go around making pretty little userboxes expressing their opinions, why don't they go on some other Wiki, or maybe LiveJournal or something? Jimbo and the Wikimedia Foundation have all their currently-overloaded servers to make an encyclopedia: not so people with a tiny amount of main articlespace edits can go around making pretty little userboxes saying that they are opposed to George W. Bush. --[[User:Deathphoenix|D]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|'''e''']][[User:Deathphoenix|ath]][[User_talk:Deathphoenix|'''phoenix''']] 13:27, 17 February 2006 (UTC)  Haukurth, please don't mistake my article edits for my only contributions to Wikipedia.

If someone is trolling, then a tame warning will indeed encourage them: if the vandalism was attention-seeking behavior and you warn, they know that they got somebody's attention. However, it's hard to tell a priori what is going on. So it's only fair to warn at least once, but warn according to the severity of the vandalism, ranging from &quot;can I edit this? LOL&quot; (a clear test-1) to some horribly malicious stuff (jump directly to test-4). The person who writes &quot;can I edit this? LOL&quot; will probably stop after test-1. If someone removes a warning or gives some other indication that they are aware of it but just don't care (like writing &quot;screw you, I can do what I want&quot;), I wouldn't hesitate to block immediately. The other thing you can try, but only for serious vandalism: warn once; if they continue, warn a second time and block for 2 minutes.

Is there anything else that can be done? This is really upsetting. [[User:Chooserr|Chooserr]] 02:14, 20 February 2006 (UTC) *Well, you might start by being more cautious in your presentation of information. For example, in [[Abortion]], you added, ''It has been reported that abortion is the leading cause of death for women reproductive age in most third world coutnries [http://www.rho.org/html/cont-ec.htm].'' However, looking at your citation, we find it saying, ''In developing countries where abortion remains illegal, unsafe abortion is a leading cause of death among women of reproductive age.'' So what's wrong about your interpretation?  *#It's '''a''' leading cause, not '''the''' leading cause. *#The article was talking about '''illegal''' abortion. *#The article said nothing about ''most third world countries''. It refers specifically to developing countries where abortion remains illegal. :If we assume good faith, we must assume that you did not understand that your presentation of the data was distorting the data; that it was an honest mistake on your part, and that when the mistake was pointed out you understood the correction. Calling it &quot;vandalism&quot; was incorrect; [[WP:VAND]] makes it clear that NPOV violations are not vandalism.

If the isp is a schoolboard connection, perhaps notifying the administration there would be a good option (on the chance that students are required to log-in to access the net, site historys may be able to i.d. the specific user?).  At my work (a homeless shelter) threats of suicide and self harm are usually reason enough to involve the police (ofcourse this can be a matter of discression depending on how serious someone appears, sometimes engaging the person will work before the police are needed. of cource, over the net, its hard to tell.) someone communicating a desire to commit suicide or self harm is a bit diffrent, we usually try to emphisize engaging the person, or getting them talking on a crisis line. if it escalates, the police would then be called.

Rule of a thumb is that the Soviet publication will enter public domain in USA after 95 years since the date of publication in the Soviet Union.

I'm also of the opinion [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;diff=40722250&amp;oldid=40721498 this edit] is either original research or POV.

Note that he would probably say the same thing about me.  Alas, my guess is that most of the editors who can attest to RJII's disruptive behavior are ones who have experienced it directly, i.e. people who have also had conflicts with him.

My suggestion would be to work with him on finding verifiable sources.  However pigheaded he may be, if he always has a verifiable source (and I think books and journal articles are better than using other encyclopedias), he will be on safe ground.  I assume no one is accusing him of violating NPOV.  See if you think there is anywhere else he may be on weak ground in terms of NOR.

In any case, it doesn't matter - if you have to ask whether or not you're violating 3RR, then you either are, or you're gaming the system. But in this case, I don't see any reason to worry. I'm saying that if you make 4 edits in a row, even if that counts as a revert (i.e. you reverted once, then you put that info back in over four edits - that's basically a second revert), that's still only one, not four. Perhaps I don't understand the question, but perhaps you shouldn't use 3RR and get some other dispute resolution steps out there. --[[User:Golbez|Golbez]] 23:54, 22 February 2006 (UTC)  ::::I suspect there's some confusion here over meaning. Cyberboomer, you ''do'' know there is a difference between &quot;change&quot; and &quot;revert&quot;, right? &quot;Revert&quot; means to change a page back to a ''previous'' version, or to restore ''removed'' material or re-delete material ''added''? There aren't any hard-and-fast rules (that I'm aware of) limiting the number of changes you can make at a time (though major changes are probably best discussed ahead of time, even if only as a courtesy); however, there '''are''' rules about ''reversing'' other editors's work, in order to prevent back-and-forth &quot;edit wars&quot; ([[WP:LAME]] has some priceless examples). --[[User:Calton|Calton]] | [[User talk:Calton|Talk]] 00:06, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</text>     </revision>

It will be housed in a new building currently under construction, which is designed to provide a ceremonial entrance on the university's east side, which is presently lacking.  (On its completion, the building will have entrances on [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]], [[Gordon Street]] and [[Gordon Square]].)  The building has also been referred to during the development process as the ''Panopticon'', named for the [[Panopticon]] by [[Jeremy Bentham]], who is associated with the college. It will have space for temporary exhibitions, a café, lecture facilities, a reading room and a display area for the [[University of London]]'s collection of rare books and manuscripts.

''Lac qui Parle'' is a [[French language|French]] translation of the native [[Sioux|Dakota]] name, meaning &quot;lake which speaks&quot;. In the 19th century, the first dictionary of the [[Dakota language]] was written, and part of the [[Bible]] was translated into that language for the first time at a mission on the site of the park.  The state park was built as part of the Lac qui Parle Flood Control Project.  [[Lac qui Parle|Lac qui Parle Lake]] is a widening of the [[Minnesota River]], and the flood control project involved building a dam at the south end of the lake.  The dam was constructed by the [[Works Progress Administration]], and other projects were built along the lake.  Besides the dam and the state park, other projects included the Watson Wayside, Lac qui Parle Parkway, and the reconstruction of the Chippewa Lac qui Parle Mission.  Three structures are included in the [[National Register of Historic Places]], including the Model Shelter, which houses a relief map (cast in reinforced concrete) of the Lac qui Parle Flood Control System and the Minnesota River Valley; the kitchen shelter; and the sanitation building.  ==References== {{reflist}} * [http://www.mnhs.org/places/nationalregister/stateparks/LacQui.html Rustic Style Resources in Minnesota State Parks: Lac qui Parle State Park]  ==External links== * [http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/lac_qui_parle/index.html Lac qui Parle State Park website] - Minnesota Department of Natural Resources  [[Category:Minnesota state parks]] [[Category:Chippewa County, Minnesota]] [[Category:Lac qui Parle County, Minnesota]] [[Category:Registered Historic Places in Minnesota]] [[Category:Registered Historic Places of religious function]] [[Category:Minnesota state historic sites]]  {{Minnesota-geo-stub}} {{Registered Historic Places}}  [[fr:Parc d'État de Lac Qui Parle]]</text>     </revision>

Throughout college he was a writer for the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'' humor [[magazine]]. During his sophomore and junior years, O'Brien served as the ''Lampoon'''s president, making him the second person ever to serve as president twice, and the first person to have done so since the 1920s. He graduated ''[[Latin honors|magna cum laude]]'' from Harvard University in 1985 with a [[Artium_Baccalaureus|B.A.]] in History and Literature.  In 2008, he received an honorary degree in Actuarial Science from [[Ball State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://educhoices.org/articles/Famous_Alumni_Where_Did_They_Go_To_College.html|title=Famous Alumni: Where Did They Go to College}}&lt;/ref&gt;  == Career == === Television writer === [[Image:Conan O'Brien - Simpsons (cropped).jpg|left|200px|thumb|O'Brien in the offices of the ''Simpsons'' writers in 1992.]] O'Brien moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] after graduation to join the writing staff of [[Home Box Office|HBO's]] ''[[Not Necessarily the News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-11|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/52144|title=Conan O'Brien|publisher=[[The A.V.

In January 1988, ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'''s executive producer [[Lorne Michaels]] hired O'Brien as a writer. During his three years on ''SNL'', he wrote such recurring sketches as &quot;Mr. Short-Term Memory&quot; and &quot;The Girl Watchers,&quot; the latter of which was first performed by [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Jon Lovitz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;speakerbio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-11|url=http://www.greatertalent.com/speakers/speakers.php?speakerid=235|title=Host of Late Night With Conan O'Brien|publisher=Greater Talent Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien also co-wrote the sketch &quot;Nude Beach&quot; with [[Robert Smigel]], a sketch in which the word &quot;[[penis]]&quot; was said or sung at least 42 times.  While on a writers' strike from ''Saturday Night Live'' following the 1987-1988 season, O'Brien put on an [[improvisational comedy]] revue, in [[Chicago]], with fellow ''SNL'' writers [[Bob Odenkirk]] and Robert Smigel called, ''[[Happy Happy Good Show]]''. While living in Chicago, O'Brien briefly was roommates with [[Jeff Garlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Jeff Garlin interview|series=[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]|airdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, O'Brien and his fellow ''SNL'' writers received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy or Variety Series.    O'Brien, like many ''SNL'' writers, occasionally appeared as an extra in sketches; his most notable appearance was as a doorman in a sketch in which [[Tom Hanks]] was inducted into the ''SNL'' &quot;[[Five-Timers Club]]&quot; for hosting his fifth episode. O'Brien returned to host the show in 2001 during its 26th season.  O'Brien co-wrote ''[[Lookwell]]'' with [[Robert Smigel]] for NBC. The pilot never went to series, but it has become a cult hit and has screened at &quot;The Other Network&quot;, a festival of un-aired TV pilots produced by [[Un-Cabaret]], featuring an extended interview with O'Brien., in which O'Brian detailed his experiences during the time he was jailed for showing his penis on live television.  From 1991{{ndash}} 1993, O'Brien was a writer and producer for ''[[The Simpsons]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;speakerbio&quot; /&gt; credited as writer or co-writer of four episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-09|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005277/|title=Conan O'Brien|publisher=[[IMDB]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the episodes he wrote, he considers &quot;[[Marge vs. the Monorail]]&quot; to be his favorite.&lt;ref name=&quot;speakerbio&quot; /&gt; Years later, in his speech given at Class Day at Harvard in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-11|url=http://thecrimson.harvard.edu/article.aspx?ref=101192|title=O'Brien Returns to Harvard|publisher=[[Harvard Crimson]]|date=2000-06-08|author=Volonnino, Michael R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien credited ''The Simpsons'' with &quot;saving&quot; him, a reference to the career slump he was experiencing prior to his hiring for that show.&lt;ref name=&quot;commencement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-11|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=692946|title=Conan O'Brien's Commencement Speech for the Harvard Class of 2000|publisher=[[everything2]]|date=2000-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2004, O'Brien's office at ''The Simpsons'' was being used as storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for episode 9F10, &quot;Marge vs. the Monorail&quot;|medium=[[DVD]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  === ''Late Night'' === [[Image:Obrienaudition1.jpg|thumb|right|O'Brien closes out his audition on the set of the ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' at NBC Burbank Studio 1]] On [[April 25]], [[1993]], [[Lorne Michaels]] suggested O'Brien try out to be [[David Letterman]]'s successor as host of ''Late Night with David Letterman,'' with [[Andy Richter]] signed on to be his sidekick.

O'Brien himself, a total unknown among the general public before being named host, was seen by many as not being worthy of the program. NBC even poked fun at this perception in a radio ad which aired shortly before the show's debut and had O'Brien relaying an anecdote where someone recognized him on the street and said, &quot;Look, honey, there's the guy who doesn't deserve his own show!&quot; Another source of criticism was the fact that O'Brien himself appeared to be very nervous and awkward during the show's early days. As a self-deprecating nod to this, the original opening sequence for ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' was animated and featured a caricature of O'Brien who sweated and pulled at his collar nervously.  The show remained on multi-week renewal cycles while NBC decided its fate. By 1996-97, O'Brien's writing and comedic style was thought to have improved, and he began to develop a growing fan base, especially with high school and college students, as well as the respect of critics and his peers. O'Brien would later poke fun at the first three years of the show when on his 10th Anniversary Special, [[Mr. T]] appeared to give O'Brien a gold necklace with a giant &quot;7&quot; on it. When O'Brien tried to point out that he's actually been on the air for ten years, Mr. T responded, &quot;I know that, fool...but you've only been funny for seven!&quot;  Since then, O'Brien and the ''Late Night'' writing team have consistently been nominated for an Emmy Award for Best Writing in a Comedy or Variety Series, and finally won in 2007. In 1997, 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2004 he and the ''Late Night'' writing staff won the [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild Award]] for Best Writing in a Comedy/Variety Series.  In 2001, he formed his own television production company, [[Conaco]], which has since shared in the production credits for ''Late Night''.  On the first episode after [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th]], O'Brien told a story of how he went to pray for the first time since just after he had been announced as the host of ''Late Night'', eight years prior. O'Brien was reported to have been shaken up and talked about a need to have faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;conan-911&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-11|url=http://www.kenjiarai.com/conan/ejokes/2001/afterterrospeech.htm|title=Speech|publisher=Ken Jiarai}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Image:Conan O'Brien at U.S. Embassy Helsinki.jpg|left|thumb|150px|O'Brien in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] in February 2006.]]   After meeting Finnish actor/director Lauri Nurkse on [[October 11]], [[2005]], O'Brien discovered that he was popular in Finland and began a long-running joke that he resembles the first female President of [[Finland]], [[Tarja Halonen]]. After joking about this for several months (which led to the recurring segment &quot;Conan O'Brien Hates My Homeland&quot; and his endorsement of her campaign), O'Brien traveled to Finland and appeared on several television shows, and met President Halonen. The trip was filmed and aired as a special.  Conan O'Brien was labeled as &quot;sexiest man of the year&quot; in 2004 and 2005.  O'Brien ad libbed the fictional website name &quot;hornymanatee.com&quot; on [[December 4]], [[2006]], after a sketch about the fictional manatee mascot and its inappropriate web-cam site. NBC opted to purchase the website [[domain name]] for $159, since the website did not previously exist. The network was concerned that someone might register the domain name and post content with which NBC would not wish to be associated, or that people would get upset and sue NBC when they found out the website is fictional.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytmanatee&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-11|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/12/arts/television/12mana.html?em&amp;ex=1166158800&amp;en=226627e969708f1a&amp;ei=5087%0A|title=So This Manatee Walks Into the Internet |publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=2006-12-12|author=Steinberg, Jacques}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC now owns the rights to [http://www.hornymanatee.com www.hornymanatee.com] for 10 years, as per Conan O'Brien.

''Late Night'' has since developed an actual website, which now has received millions of hits, reaching 4 million page views in four days. People send in &quot;horny manatee&quot; artwork, poems, and other content. According to the Alexa website ranking system, Hornymanatee.com has had over 10 million web hits.  A popular recurring bit on the show is ''[[Pale Force]]'', a series of animated episodes in which comedian [[Jim Gaffigan]] and O'Brien are superheroes who fight crime with their &quot;paleness.&quot;  As Gaffigan introduces each new episode, O'Brien protests the portrayal of his character as cowardly, weak and incontinent.

Leno stated on the show that he wanted to avoid a repeat of the controversy and hard feelings that resulted when he was chosen by NBC to host the ''Tonight Show'' over [[David Letterman]].  In 2008, Conan O'Brien staged a [[The Colbert/O'Brien/Stewart feud‎|feud]] with [[Comedy Central]]'s [[Jon Stewart]] (of ''[[The Daily Show]]'') and [[Stephen Colbert]] (of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'') over a dispute about which of the three were responsible for giving [[Mike Huckabee]]'s campaign to become the Republican presidential nominee a &quot;bump.&quot; This fight crossed over between all three shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-11|url=http://embeds.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/02/06/who-created-huckabee-conan-stewart-and-colbert-fight-it-out/|title=Who Created Huckabee?

Instead of his usual upbeat antics and monologue, O'Brien sadly announced that he had just received news about the sudden death of his good friend, fellow NBC employee and frequent ''Late Night'' guest, [[Tim Russert]]. O'Brien proceeded to show two clips of his favorite Russert ''Late Night'' moments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzmachine.com/2008/06/14/tim-russert/ Conan O'Brien Pays Tribute to Tim Russert]&lt;/ref&gt;  On [[July 21]], [[2008]], NBC announced that O'Brien will take over the tonight show on [[June 1]], [[2009]] and will post reruns of &quot;Late Night&quot; until [[Jimmy Fallon]] takes over.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_tonight_show&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25786482/|title=Leno out on May 29, O’Brien in on June 1|date=July 21, 2008|publisher=[[The Associated Press]]|accessdate=2008-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  === Other work === {{trivia|date=October 2008}} O'Brien and [[Robert Smigel]] wrote the television pilot ''[[Lookwell]]'', starring [[Adam West]]. The pilot aired on NBC in 1991, but was not picked up as a series.  It was rerun in 2002 on the [[Trio]] network.  O'Brien played [[Moleculo]] in a skit on [[Saturday Night Live|SNL]].  O'Brien appears as a character in the 1999 film, ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]]'', voiced by [[Brent Spiner]]. O'Brien later appeared in [[South Park]] in the episode &quot;[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]&quot;. In 2006, he voiced himself in a short South Park scene as part of the opening of the 2006 [[Emmy Awards]].  O'Brien is an avid [[guitarist]] and music listener. When [[Bruce Springsteen]] and the Sessions Band appeared on the show as a musical guest, O'Brien joined the 17 piece band along with the Max Weinberg 7 and guests [[Jimmy Fallon]] &amp; [[Thomas Haden Church]] and played [[acoustic guitar]] and contributed backup vocals for the song, &quot;[[Pay Me My Money Down]]&quot;.  In 2005, O'Brien appeared in [[The White Stripes]] music video, &quot;[[The Denial Twist]]&quot;. The band had previously been a week-long musical guest on ''Late Night'' when they were promoting their 2003 album, ''[[Elephant (album)|Elephant]]''.  He has appeared on another late-night talk show, ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' (''SGC2C''), in Episode 77: ''Fire Ant'', in which he and Space Ghost argue about a number of topics, including whether or not anyone actually watches ''SGC2C''. [[Space Ghost]] later quips, &quot;Well, that's very stupid, and you won't make it in television,&quot; an obvious parody of early reviews of O'Brien's show. A short time later, Space Ghost leaves the interview in order to follow a fire ant that bit him. As Space Ghost is crawling out of the studio, O'Brien gripes that &quot;For all these people know, my show is a cop show on Fox or something!&quot; Space Ghost replies, &quot;Isn't it?&quot;  O'Brien made an appearance on the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' &quot;Star Wars Special&quot; on [[June 17]], [[2007]] as the voice of the bounty hunter Zuckuss. In a parody of Late Night, Zuckuss hosts a talk show called &quot;Late Night with Zuckuss. O'Brien's &quot;[[Sketches from Late Night with Conan O'Brien#Fake celebrity interviews|Fake Celebrity Interviews]]&quot; segment was even spoofed when Zuckuss did a &quot;fake interview&quot; with [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]]. Typical of Conan's fake interviews, the fake Palpatine made a fool of himself; the implication was that the actual Palpatine was not pleased, as, in the final moments of the sketch, the [[Death Star]] can be seen approaching through a window in Zuckuss' studio, aiming and firing{{ndash}} then there is a &quot;Technical Difficulties&quot; test pattern. He also appeared in Season one on the show in two roles. First as a pizza delivery man who is not aware of his customer's sexy advances; and as a wrestling announcer with historical figures as pro wrestlers.  Conan was a guest star on the hit TV show ''[[30 Rock]]'' in which he played himself. In the episode &quot;Tracy Does Conan&quot;, Conan has the character [[Tracy Jordan]] on his show, despite having been assaulted in a previous attempt to have him on his show.    Conan made a cameo appearance on the US version of ''[[The Office US|The Office]]''.  In the episode &quot;[[Valentine's Day (The Office episode)|Valentine's Day]]&quot;, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael]] believed that he spotted someone that looks like former ''[[Saturday Night Live|SNL]]'' cast member [[Tina Fey]], but mistakes another woman for her. In the meantime, Conan has a quick walk-on and the camera-crew informs Michael when he returns from talking to the Tina Fey look-alike.  In 2002, Conan helped write and produce [[Andy Richter Controls the Universe]], a comedy series that ran for two seasons. It was cancelled mostly due to poor ratings.  On [[March 7]], [[2006]], NBC announced a new adventure/comedy series entitled ''[[Andy Barker, P.I.]]''.  O'Brien was executive producer and also co-wrote the pilot. The show starred O'Brien's former sidekick [[Andy Richter]]. After six episodes and low ratings, the show was canceled despite being named by Entertainment Weekly as one of the Top Ten Shows of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-11|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20162677_20164091_20166802,00.html|title=Andy Barker, P.I. |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2007-12-21|author=Flynn, Gillian }}&lt;/ref&gt;  O'Brien also hosted the [[58th Primetime Emmy Awards]] on [[August 27]], [[2006]], to critical acclaim.&lt;ref name=&quot;variety&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-11|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117931393?categoryid=1264&amp;cs=1|title=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117931393?categoryid=1264&amp;cs=1|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2006-08-27|author=Adalian, Josef}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously hosted the Primetime Emmys in 2002, and Co-Hosted in 2003.

David Ajemian of the Archdiocese of Boston, who, despite multiple warnings to stop, had been sending O'Brien letters signed as &quot;your priest stalker&quot; and coming in contact with O'Brien's parents. Ajemian sent a letter to O'Brien, frustrated that he had been denied a spot in the ''Late Night'' audience. He stated in his letter to O'Brien that he flew to New York, &quot;in the dimming hope that you might finally acknowledge me.&quot; He also stated in another letter that, &quot;Is this the way you treat your most dangerous fans??? You owe me big time pal.&quot; Ajemian also seemed to have made a death threat to O'Brien in another letter; saying, &quot;Remember [[Frank Costello]] once dodged a bullet in your building and so can you.&quot; Ajemian then tried to forcefully enter a taping of ''Late Night'', but was caught and arrested. He was previously warned by the NBC security team to stay away from the studio. After a psychological evaluation, he was deemed fit to stand trial.

It is housed in a three-story building in [[Duluth, Minnesota]] on the shores of [[Lake Superior]] and has numerous large and smaller satellite tanks that comprise the 120,000 gallon facility. Construction took 3.5 years and cost around $34 million.  All of the main exhibits of the 62,000 square foot Great Lakes Aquarium (GLA) are based upon actual habitats in the Lake Superior basin. &quot;Slices&quot; of the [[St. Louis River]], Baptism River, [[Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore]], Kakagon Slough, [[Isle Royale]] and Otter Cove can all be viewed up close.  ==Permanent Fixtures== ===Isle Royale=== 85,000 gallon [[Isle Royale]] is the main exhibit located in the very center of the building, and it extends to both the first and second floors allowing visitors to view it from many different angles.  ===Baptism River=== Baptism River is a fast-moving exhibit featuring a waterfall.  It contains rainbow, brown, and brook trout, as well as sculpin and longnose suckers.  ===St. Louis River=== The [[St. Louis River]] exhibit is a slow-moving river habitat with perch, walleye, gar, sturgeon, channel catfish, and other native species.  ===Pictured Rocks / Kakagon Slough=== [[Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore|Pictured Rocks]] and Kakagon Slough are inside of a netted area and feature sandstone cliffs, live songbirds, ducks, and wetland plants.  ===Otter Cove=== Otter Cove is an exhibit that houses two river otters and was designed after a cove in Pukaskwa Provincial Park.  Directly to the left is an exhibit containing a live bald eagle.  ===Other Permanent Exhibits=== 19 satellite tanks are at various locations and contain animals such as fish, frogs, salamanders and snakes.  There is also a wide variety of interactive electronic exhibits located throughout the museum.  Great Lakes Aquarium also features a local history center, a science center and cultural exhibits.    ==Traveling Exhibits== As of [[May 25]], [[2007]], Great Lakes Aquarium is currently hosting the traveling exhibit &quot;Seahorse Secrets&quot; in the Sandra and Roger Karon Exhibit Hall.  Prior to this date, traveling exhibit &quot;The Abyss: the Great Unknown&quot; occupied this space.  It explored deep-ocean exploration and was GLA's first foray into saltwater exhibits.  The Abyss is based on the research of [[Robert Ballard|Bob Ballard]] and houses over forty interactive displays and live marine animal exhibits.  Other traveling exhibits of the past include &quot;Africa's Lake Victoria,&quot; which ended October 2003 and &quot;Hunters of the Sky,&quot; which ended September 2001.  ==Architecture== Holt Hinshaw had the original vision and Hammel, Green and Abrahamson, Inc. (HGA) made it a reality.  An office area at the rear of the first floor has been cleared out to host birthday parties and other pre-arranged events.  There is an incredible harbor view from this area to say the least.  When visitors enter the museum, they are encouraged to ride the escalator to the upper level first through Sensory Immersion Experience and continue onto the lower level later. ===Main Floor=== The main floor contains the following features: *Traveling Exhibit *Gift Shop *Otter Cove *Bald Eagle *Great Lakes Water Table *Isle Royale *Wow of Water *Touch Tanks *International Lakes *Amazon River *Boardroom *Harborview Suite Party Room *Learning Labs *Behind the Scenes *Lake Superior Deep Water Benthic Explorer  ===Upper Level=== *Origins *Human Migration *World of Water *Harbor View *Baptism River *Isle Royale *St. Louis River *Uplands *Weather Station *Pictured Rocks *Kakagon Slough *Marketplace (interactive exhibits) *Caretaking *Lake Superior Cafe (defunct)  ===Basement=== The basement of this building is closed to the public.  This level contains large quarantine and life support equipment rooms centered beneath [[Isle Royale]].  Hallways wrap around these large rooms.  The husbandry kitchen, exhibit technician's office, workshop, electrical and temperature equipment control rooms, and autopsy lab are on the west hall.  The east hall contains the breakroom, restrooms, and other rooms.  The south hall is very short, but it gives access to the computer control room, a storeroom, and a garage.  There is also a large office area located below the part of the building that has a red exterior.  ==History== The facility has never met the attendance and financial projections of its promoters. In 2002 it was effectively taken over by the City of Duluth, which was responsable for its debts.   Though temporarily closed in the fall of 2002, GLA reopened that winter on weekends and soon resumed operations 365 days a year.  Daily operations of GLA were contracted out to [[Ripley's Entertainment]], Leisure Entertainment Management division, best known for their ''Believe it or not'' museums. Ripley's management reduced staff from a high of 90 down to 30 and cut costs in other areas bringing the Aquarium back from the immediate threat of permanent closure.  According to a report aired on WDIO-TV in Duluth in June 2007, each successive year since Ripley's management of GLA has shown a notable drop in attendance from the previous year with projections dropping even more rapidly in the future.  Even though it operates at a significant loss, GLA receives subsidies from Duluth of up to $300,000 annually so it could last indefinitely.  On June 9, 2008, Mayor Don Ness outlined a plan to reduce the aquarium's subsidy by $100,000 due to a budget deficit in the city of Duluth.  On June 29, 2008, it was announced that the aquarium would temporarily add an international passenger terminal so that cruise ship passengers from the 290-foot cruise ship [[Clelia II]] could be processed on site.  According to the Chicago Tribune, &quot;Jack LaVoy, executive director of the aquarium, said a temporary passenger center could provide some welcome extra revenue for the attraction.  'We hope this is the beginning of what could become many cruises,' he said.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-ap-mn-cruiseshipcomprom,0,1605383.story&lt;/ref&gt;  ==Notes== &lt;references/&gt;  ==References== &quot;A Walking Tour of Great Lakes Aquarium&quot; volunteer orientation manual  ==External links== * [http://216.70.11.13/view/index.shtml live camera of THE Great Lakes Aquarium] * [http://www.glaquarium.org/ Great Lakes Aquarium home page] * [http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200007/28_kelleherb_aqua-m/ NPR article] * [http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/07/29_kelleherb_aquarium Great Lakes Aquarium Anniversary] * [http://www.lakesuperior.com/online/223/223gla.html &quot;More from the Sturgeon General,&quot; Lake Superior Magazine] * [http://www.ci.duluth.mn.us/city/government/mayor/glaquarium.htm Mayor's Task Force Recommendations (January 15, 2003)]  {{zoos}} {{Zoos of Minnesota}} {{Museums in Minnesota}}  {{coord|46|46|45.3606|N|92|6|0.9972|W|display=title}}  [[Category:Aquaria in Minnesota]] [[Category:Museums in Minnesota]] [[Category:Duluth, Minnesota]]</text>     </revision>

This list includes not only those who sworn into office as [[President of Portugal]] but also those who ''de facto'' served as head of state since 1910. This is the case of [[Teófilo Braga]] who served as President of the Provisional Government after the republican coup d'état. Also [[Sidónio Pais]], [[Mendes Cabeçadas]], [[Gomes da Costa]], as well as [[Canto e Castro]] and [[Óscar Carmona]] in their early months, weren't sworn into office as President of the Republic, usually being the [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|President of the Ministry]] (Prime Minister), but ''de facto'' accumulation this functions with that of the Head of State.

''Isthmus Zapotec attitudes toward sex and gender anomalies,'' pp. 293-302 in Stephen O. Murray (ed.), &quot;Latin American Male Homosexualities&quot; Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press.&lt;br&gt;Chiñas (p. 294) defines muxe as “persons who appear to be predominantly male but display certain female characteristics” and fill a “third gender role between men and women, taking some of the characteristics of each.”&lt;/ref&gt; Some marry women and have children while others choose men as sexual or romantic partners.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen, Lynn  (2002), ''Sexualities and Genders in Zapotec Oaxaca''. {{PDF|[http://www.uky.edu/~tmute2/mexico/MexWeb/Mex%20PDFs/stephan-gender-zapotec.pdf Article online]|98.6&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]&lt;!-- application/pdf, 101020 bytes --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to anthropologist [[Lynn Stephen]], muxe &quot;may do certain kinds of women’s work such as embroidery or decorating home altars, but others do the male work of making jewelry. Many now have white-collar jobs and are involved in politics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibid]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''muxe'' is thought to derive from the 16th century Spanish word for &quot;woman&quot;, ''mujer''.  ==Muxe and gender in Zapotec culture== In contrast to Mexico's dominant ''[[mestizo]]'' culture (where [[machismo]] prevails), Oaxaca has a predominantly Zapotec population, and it is widely reported that there is less hostility toward muxe in the region than homosexual, effeminate males and [[transwoman|transwomen]] face elsewhere in the strongly Catholic country. One study estimates that 6 percent of males in an Isthmus Zapotec community in the early 1970s were muxe.&lt;ref&gt;Rymph, David (1974). ''Cross-sex behavior in an Isthmus Zapotec village.'' Paper presented at the annual meeting of the [[American Anthropological Association]], Mexico City.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Zapotec communities have similar &quot;third gender&quot; roles, such as the ''[[biza’ah]]'' of [[Teotitlán]].  Muxe may be ''vestidas'' ([[transvestite]]s) or ''pintadas'' (wearing male clothes and make-up). It has been suggested that while the three gender system predates Spanish colonization, the phenomenon of muxe dressing as women is fairly recent, beginning in the 1950s and gaining popularity until nearly all of the younger generation of muxe today are ''vestidas''.&lt;ref&gt;Gómez Regalado, Amaranta (2005). ''Transcending''. {{PDF|[http://www.2spirits.com/TrascendiendoEnglishversion.pdf Article online]|50.0&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]&lt;!-- application/pdf, 51232 bytes --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within contemporary Zapotec culture, reports vary as to their social status. Muxe in village communites may not be disparaged, while in larger towns they may face some discrimination, especially from men.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen, Lynn, [[op cit]].&lt;/ref&gt; Muxe generally belong to the poorer classes of society. Gender variance and same-sex desire in wealthier communities of the region are more likely to follow a more western taxonomy of gay, bisexual and transgender. Such individuals are also more likely to remain in &quot;[[the closet]]&quot;.  In an article published in 1995, anthropologist [[Beverly Chiñas]] explains that in the Zapotec culture, &quot;the idea of choosing gender or of sexual orientation is as ludicrous as suggesting that one can choose one's skin color.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chiñas, Beverly (1995). ''Isthmus Zapotec attitudes toward sex and gender anomalies,'' pp. 293-302 in Stephen O. Murray (ed.), &quot;Latin American Male Homosexualities&quot; Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Most people traditionally view their gender as something God has given them (whether man, woman, or muxe), and few muxe desire genital surgery.   Lynn Stephen writes: &quot;Muxe men are not referred to as “homosexuals” but constitute a separate category based on gender attributes. People perceive them as having the physical bodies of men but different aesthetic, work, and social skills from most men. They may have some attributes of women or combine those of men and women.&quot; If they do choose men as sexual partners, neither are those men (known as ''mayate'') necessarily considered homosexual.  ==Prominent muxe individuals== In 2003, 25-year-old muxe [[Amaranta Gómez Regalado]] from [[Juchitán de Zaragoza]] gained international prominence as a congressional candidate for the [[Mexico Possible]] party in the [[2003 Mexican elections|Oaxaca state elections]]. Her broad platform included calls for the decriminalization of marijuana and abortion.   ==Media== In 2005, [[Alejandra Islas]] directed a documentary about muxes in [[Juchitán de Zaragoza]] entitled ''Muxes: Auténticas, intrépidas y buscadoras de peligro''.  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==Further reading== *Roscoe,Will (1998).

Her symbol is a white feather.  ==Description== Fionnghuala is a small, very slender human woman with red hair and green eyes. She wears white feathered patches on her shoulders and on the crown of her head, and gossomer armor. She may also appear as a giant swan.  ==Realm== Fionnghuala is part of the Outer Circle of the [[Seelie Court (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Seelie Court]], though her duties often take her elsewhere. She attends meetings of mortal swanmays, flies in swan form as a sentinel around faerie lands, and eagerly plans for assaults against the Unseelie fey. She can often be found wandering [[Elysium (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Elysium]] on various tasks.  ==Dogma== Fionnghuala is fiercely loving and protective of good-aligned faerie folk, and will slay any who deliberately kills a faerie in her presence.  ==Worshippers== Fionnghuala is revered by swanmays, a secretive organization of female human rangers with the ability to transform into swans. They continue to worship the deities who were their patrons before their transformation as well. Fionnghuala has no clerics.  ==Myths and legends== Fionnghuala was once a mortal human ranger who gave many services to the [[Fey (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|fey]] and their kind. Fionnghuala was gravely wounded during a battle against an avatar of the [[Queen of Air and Darkness (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Queen of Air and Darkness]] while selflessly protecting the avatar of [[Oberon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Oberon]]. In reward for her services, Titania raised her from the dead and brought her to the [[Seelie Court (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Seelie Court]]. She was given a white feather that allowed her to take on the form of a swan, changing her from a mortal being to something partly of Faerie. Over the centuries since this event, a small, secretive sorority of rangers have been granted simulacra of this feather, allowing them to become swanmays as well.  ==Creative origins== Fionnghuala's name comes from [[Fionnuala]], a swan maiden in [[Celtic mythology]].  ==References== * McComb, Colin.

When he was 13 years old, he and his friends started their own band. He joined Kool &amp; The Gang in 1978 and became the band's lead singer in 1979.  Together, they released the [[record album|album]] ''[[Ladies' Night (1979 album)|Ladies' Night]]''. Taylor's creamy voice helped the [[single (music)|single]]s &quot;Too Hot&quot; and &quot;[[Ladies' Night (song)|Ladies' Night]]&quot; reach [[gold disc|gold]] and platinum status. The group's change to a [[popular music|pop]] sound was raised by [[record producer|producer]] [[Eumir Deodato]], who, starting with ''Ladies' Night'', produced the group's next four platinum and gold albums, between 1979 and 1982. With the help of [[Deodato]], the group's next album, ''[[Celebrate!]]'', became one of the biggest hits of their career. In 1988 he separated amicably from Kool &amp; The Gang.   As a solo artist, Taylor released four solo albums to date. Signing with [[MCA Records]], he started his solo career and released his [[Debut album|debut]] album ''Master of the Game'' in 1989. Taylor had a hit with his first solo single: a [[duet]] with [[soul (music)|soul]] siren [[Regina Belle]] entitled &quot;All I Want Is Forever&quot;. Two singles from that album, &quot;Sister Rosa&quot; and &quot;8 Days a Week&quot; got substantial airplay. He completed his second solo album, ''Feel the Need'', in 1991, and two songs from that album, &quot;Long Hot Summer Night&quot; and his duet with [[Stephanie Mills]], &quot;Heart to Heart&quot;, were minor hits. After that he also released ''Baby I'm Back''.   During the mid-1990s, Taylor made both his [[Hollywood]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[acting]] debuts in ''[[The Mambo Kings]]'' and ''[[Raisin (musical)|Raisin]]'', respectively. Taylor returned to Kool &amp; The Gang in 1995. However, Taylor is not to be found on Kool and the Gang's latest release, ''Still Kool'' (2007).  Taylor released his fourth solo album, ''A Brand New Me'', in 2000.  Taylor at some point suffered a stroke and has said he can no longer sing. He currently lives with his wife and son in New Jersey. ==External links== * {{Imdb name|id=0852486|name=J T Taylor}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Taylor, James &quot;JT&quot;}} [[Category:1953 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:African American singers]] [[Category:American rhythm and blues singers]] [[Category:American male singers]] [[Category:Kool &amp; the Gang members]] [[Category:People from South Carolina]]  [[de:James &quot;JT&quot; Taylor]] [[nl:James &quot;JT&quot; Taylor]]</text>     </revision>

It is second only to the nearly indefatigable palm and needle whipping.     == Technique == The twine is first threaded diagonally through the rope.  The twine is then wrapped round the rope including the diagonally threaded end.  A needle is then used to thread the two ends through the rope to enclose the wrapping turns.  Finally a reef (square) or a string of reef (square) knots is tied.  Then this string of reef (square) knots is pulled through the rope to bury the ends.    == Alternatives == [[Image:Westcountry.jpg|left|West Country Whipping]]The [[West country whipping]] is a quick practical method of using twine to secure the end of a rope to prevent it fraying.  Half hitches are tied alternately behind and in front of the rope until the width of the band of twine approaches the diameter of the rope.  It has several advantages: it can be tied without a needle; it is simple to understand and remember; if the whipping fails, the loose ends can usually be re-tied to temporarily prevent the rope's end from fraying.    '''Burning the Rope's End:''' The end of many synthetic ropes can be melted using heat, e.g., a flame.  While this is simple and quick, it tends to fail in ropes subject to heavy use.  Ideally a rope's end should be both melted (if applicable) and whipped.  == External links == *[http://www.animatedknots.com/sailmakers/ Animated Knots by Grog: Sailmaker's Whipping]</text>     </revision>

The ends of the rope are tucked (plaited) back into the standing end to form the loop.  Originally this splice was described with each end being tucked only about three times.  When the splice was made in tarred hemp or cotton this was reasonably safe.  With modern synthetic ropes, five complete tucks is a minimum and additional tucks are recommended for critical loads.  The eyesplice is also commonly used on [[Wire_rope#Eyesplice|wire rope]].  == Technique == The ends of the rope are first wrapped in tape or heated with a flame to prevent each end from fraying completely.    The rope is unlayed for a distance equal to three times the diameter for each &quot;tuck&quot;, e.g., for five tucks in half inch rope, undo about 7.5 inches.  Wrap the rope at that point to prevent it unwinding further.  Form the loop and plait the three ends back against the twist of the rope.  Practice is required to keep each end to retain its twist and lie neatly.  In stiff old rope or in new rope which has been tightly wound, a [[marlinspike]] or [[fid]] can facilitate opening up the strands and threading each end.   In some cases, the splice is tapered by trimming the working strands after each tuck.  Also, the splice can be [[Whipping knot |whipped]] to protect and strengthen the splice.  The eye splice has several advantages. The most notable is the permanence of the loop. An equally important, but less noted advantage, is the lack of stress it puts on the rope. Splices average 10-15% of rope strength decay which is very low compared to even the strongest knots. Literature and reference sources typically attribute only a 5% strength decay for a properly tied splice. Technically, a perfectly tied splice retains 100% of the original strength of the rope, but only a trained professional is considered capable of performing this task. Destructive testing of rope in manufacturing facilities makes use of a professional and spliced eyes for connecting the rope to the testing apparatus.  == Alternatives == The [[Bowline]] is a quick practical method of forming a loop in the end of a piece of rope.  However, the bowline has an awkward tendency to shake undone when not loaded.  The bowline also reduces the strength of the rope at the knot to ~45% of the original unknotted strength. {{knot-stub}} == External links == *[http://www.animatedknots.com/splice/ Eye Splice Animated]  [[Category:Knots]]  [[de:Augspleiß]] [[nl:Oogsplits]]</text>     </revision>

[[Qing Dynasty]] illustration. |t=周倉 |s=周仓 }} {{chinese-name|[[Zhou (surname)|Zhou]] (周)}}  '''Zhou Cang''' is a fictional character created by [[Luo Guanzhong]] in his historical novel, [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]. A strong warrior with a dark face and a wiry beard, Zhou Cang became caught up in the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] and joined the rebels. It was during this time that he first met [[Guan Yu]], who impressed him with his courage and sense of honor. However, after the Rebellion was crushed by [[Han Dynasty|Han]] troops, Zhou Cang became a renegade bandit. He inhabited [[Mount Woniu]] with another former Yellow Turban, [[Pei Yuanshao]] and became infamous as a warrior of great strength and skill. After encountering Guan Yu once more on a mountain road, he swore his loyalty to the worthy general and was appointed to the rank of Guan Yu's Saber Carrier. A skilled boatman, his talents were critical in helping achieve Guan Yu's water attack at the [[Battle of Fancheng]]. At Fan, he managed to capture the fearsome warrior [[Pang De]] during the flooding of the castle. Unfortunately, his fierce loyalty to his lord would cost him his life, when, upon seeing the heads of Guan Yu and [[Guan Ping]] displayed by the forces of [[Eastern Wu|Wu]], he committed suicide. After Guan Yu was made a deity, Zhou Cang was made part of the holy trio, along with Guan Yu's adopted son Guan Ping. His face is often portrayed as coal black, a stark contrast to Guan Ping's pure white features, and Guan Yu's shades or red.  ==See also==  *[[Three Kingdoms]] *[[Personages of the Three Kingdoms]] *''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]''  == References == *Luo Guanzhong (1986).

The exact frequency that the keys are changed is negotiated, but may be as frequent as every packet.  MPPE alone does not compress or expand data, but the protocol is often used in conjunction with [[Microsoft Point-to-Point Compression]] which compresses data across PPP or VPN links.  Negotiation of MPPE happens within the Compression Control Protocol (CCP), a subprotocol of PPP.

A field is a setting in which [[human agency|agents]] and their [[social position]]s are located. The position of each particular agent in the field is a result of interaction between the specific rules of the field, agent's [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]] and agent's capital ([[social capital|social]], [[economic capital|economic]] and [[cultural capital|cultural]]) (Bourdieu, 1984). Fields interact with each other, and are hierarchical (most are subordinate of the larger field of [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[social class|class]] relations).  Bourdieu shared [[Max Weber|Weber]]'s view,  contrary to traditional [[Marxism]], that society cannot be analyzed simply in terms of economic classes and ideologies. Much of his work concerns the independent role of educational and cultural factors. Instead of analyzing societies in terms of classes, Bourdieu uses the concept of ''field'': a social arena in which people maneuver and struggle in pursuit of desirable resources.  In Bourdieu's work, a field is a system of social positions (e.g. a profession such as law) structured internally in terms of [[power (sociology)|power]] [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s (e.g. the power differential between judges and lawyers). More specifically, a field is a social arena of struggle over the [[appropriation]] of certain species of capital--capital being whatever is taken as significant for social agents (the most obvious example is monetary capital). Fields are organized both vertically and horizontally. This means that fields are not strictly analogous to classes, and are often autonomous, independent spaces of social play. The field of power is peculiar in that it exists 'horizontally' through all of the fields and the struggles within it control the 'exchange rate' of the forms of cultural, symbolic, or physical capital between the fields themselves. A field is constituted by the relational differences in position of social agents, and the boundaries of a field are demarcated by where its effects end. Different fields can be either autonomous or interrelated (e.g. consider the separation of power between judiciary and legislature) and more complex societies are &quot;more differentiated&quot; societies that have more fields.  Fields are constructed according to underlying [[nomos (sociology)|nomos]], fundamental principles of &quot;vision and division&quot; (the division between [[mind-body dualism|mind and body]] for example, or male and female), or organizing &quot;laws&quot; of experience that govern practices and experiences within a field. The nomos underlying one field is often irreducible to those underlying another, as in the noted disparity between the nomos of the aesthetic field that values cultural capital and in some sense discourages economic capital, and that of the economic field which values economic capital. Agents subscribe to a particular field not by way of explicit contract, but by their practical acknowledgement of the stakes, implicit in their very &quot;playing of the game&quot;. The acknowledgement of the stakes of the field and the acquiring of interests and investments prescribed by the field is termed [[illusio]].  ==See also== *[[Sexual field]]     {{socio-stub}}  [[Category:Sociological terms]]  [[de:Soziales Feld]] [[es:Campo (sociología)]] [[he:שדה (סוציולוגיה)]] [[pl:Pole (socjologia)]]</text>     </revision>

This white high-melting solid hydrolyzes rapidly in humid air. It is a key [[reagent]] in the chemistry of [[zirconium]].  ==Structure== Unlike [[titanium(IV) chloride|TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; adopts a polymeric structure wherein each Zr is octahedrally coordinated.  This difference in structures, polymeric vs. molecular, is responsible for the striking difference in their properties - one being distillable, the other being a high melting solid.  In the solid state, ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; adopts a tape-like linear polymeric structure--the same structure adopted by [[Hafnium(IV) chloride|HfCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]. This polymer degrades readily upon treatment with [[Lewis base]]s, which cleave the Zr-Cl-Zr linkages.&lt;ref&gt;N. N. Greenwood &amp; A. Earnshaw, ''Chemistry of the Elements'' (2nd ed.), Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford, '''1997'''.&lt;/ref&gt;  ==Kroll process== ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is an intermediate in the conversion of zirconium minerals to metallic [[zirconium]] by the [[Kroll process]]. In nature, zirconium minerals invaribly exists as oxides (reflected also by the tendency of all zirconium chlorides to hydrolyze).  For their conversion to bulk metal,  these refractory oxides are first converted to the tetrachloride, which can be distilled at high temperatures.  This conversion entails treatment of the oxide with carbon as the oxide &quot;getter&quot; and chlorine. :ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 C  +  2 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →  ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 CO  ==Chemical reactions== ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the principal starting compound for the synthesis of many organometallic complexes of zironcium.&lt;ref&gt;New Aspects of Zirconium Containing Organic Compounds.

Created by writer [[David Michelinie]], penciller [[Erik Larsen]], he first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''  #342 (December 1990).  ==Fictional character biography== ===Origin=== Elias Wirtham is a doctor driven by his brother's death to researching life-saving medical practices. His brother Joshua's death was the result of corporate greed, who had a cure for his condition ready, but did not distribute the medicine due to it not being a &quot;profitable&quot; time for them, hence his motivation against corporations. As a part of his research, Elias replaces his heart with a beta-particle reactor, which supplies energy throughout his body, in addition to a [[vibranium]] weave mesh under his skin.  This energy, channeled through his muscles, increases his speed, agility, and reflexes, and can also be fired through his fists or the power staff he wields.  He adopts the moniker &quot;Cardiac&quot; in reference to the source of his power.&lt;ref&gt;origin as revealed in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #376&lt;/ref&gt;  Wirtham is a physician and surgeon, and the owner and administrator of a biological research firm.  ===History=== Cardiac becomes a vigilante, believing himself an instrument of justice. He first encountered [[Spider-Man]] while raiding Sapridyne Chemicals, a company owned by [[Justin Hammer]] which possessed chemicals vital for the production of cocaine.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #344&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiac next destroys the house and property of Albert Brukner, a corrupt [[Savings and loan association|S &amp; L]] broker, and then attacked a subsidiary of [[Obadiah Stane|Stane International]] that manufactured dangerous electronic dolls for children.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #359&lt;/ref&gt; He invaded Stane International itself to destroy designs for a sonic missile that produced the effects of nerve gas.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #360&lt;/ref&gt;   Cardiac targets a filmmaker whose film is [[Media violence research|indirectly responsible]] for a boy murdering his family. However, Cardiac incidentally encounters [[Styx and Stone]], and is inadvertently embroiled in a fight between [[Styx and Stone|Styx, Stone]] and Spider-Man.  At different times fighting each of them, Cardiac eventually cooperates with Spider-Man and together they defeat Styx and Stone.  Afterward, Spider-Man attempts to restrain him, but he escapes.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #376-377&lt;/ref&gt;  He next battled [[Code: Blue]].&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;   Shortly thereafter, [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] was dispatched to kill Cardiac, but was defeated by him. Cardiac returns periodically to perform his version of justice. He will not hesitate to kill criminals, but he is often bothered by his conscience that he has to. Cardiac later targeted a shipment of drugs, and again encounters Spider-Man. After defeating the hero, he destroys the shipment, saying that he wasn't &quot;there to destroy a misguided hero&quot;.  Cardiac also confronts [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] and [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] during Blaze's mission to rescue his missing son from an evil corporation.  When [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] seemingly goes on a rampage (he had been taken over by an alien) Cardiac is one of the many superheroes who attempts to bring him down. Pairing with [[Solo (Marvel Comics)|Solo]] does not help, as they are both swiftly defeated. Wolverine turns Cardiac's weapon on a nearby building. Cardiac is stunned and buried under several large chunks of masonry.  ===The Initiative=== Elias is being considered as a &quot;potential recruit&quot; for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program, according to ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''.  ==Powers and abilities== Cardiac's heart has been surgically replaced with a compact beta-particle reactor, which grants Cardiac power. He has the ability to channel beta particles through the neural web of his vibranium-mesh skin into his muscles thereby endowing him with superhuman strength and regeneration, and enhanced speed, agility, reflexes, and endurance, and he can channel these particles through external objects (such as his pulse staff and hang glider). He wields his pulse staff which fires concussive force bolts, and rides a beta-propelled stingray hang-glider, which were both invented by Wirtham and his associates.  Dr. Elias Wirtham's business administrative skills provide him a strong power base with a number of connections to various enterprises.  He has also earned an M.D. degree and is an accomplished physician and surgeon.  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==External links== *[http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/cardiac.html Profile at Spiderfan.org] *http://marvel.com/universe/Cardiac  {{Spider-Man}} [[Category:Fictional African-Americans]] [[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]] [[Category:Fictional doctors]] [[Category:Fictional vigilantes]] [[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]] [[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]  [[fr:Cardiac]]</text>     </revision>

It is the first game of the [[Assault Suits series]].    == Overview == ''Target Earth'' is about [[Earth]]'s outcasts, who have become Cyborgs, returning from space to attack the civilization that remained behind.  The Earth Defense League fought to defend earth in a galactic war.  The battle begins in [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]].  The game alternates between battles in space, on planets, on the earth and inside enemy outposts.   In the Assault Suit Valken 2, player's side is named OPTOF (Outer Planet Treaty Organization Force) and enemy side is named Daess.  == Gameplay == Much of the games mechanics fall inline with a [[platform game]].  Depending on how well you performed in the previous stage, you were rewarded with more weapons and ammo in the next stage.  The game did feature 15 weapons, which was considered a lot of firepower for a platform game in the early 90s. Adding accessories like shields, armors and hover packs, the game would add replay value depending on what you bring to battle.  ==Fan base== Some fans consider it as one of the hardest games ever, but a good game nonetheless.{{Or|date=August 2008}}{{Fact|date=August 2008}} The game featured some of the best parallax effects on the Mega Drive/Genesis system during the period of the game's release.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} Target Earth filled a void at a time when franchised [[Robotech]]-like video games were virtually nonexistent in the US.{{Or|date=August 2008}}{{Fact|date=August 2008}}  ==Remake==  Assault Suit Valken 2, a strategy game released for [[Playstation]], is actually a remake of original Target Earth. Both games, although different in genre and name, have more or less the same story: Outcasts return to Earth and attack the Earth Government that left them behind. Just like the first game, war begins in Ganymede. However, ASV2 has a more detailed story and many new characters. ASV2 never released in English and didn't receive much attention in Japan either, possibly because it was released shortly after [[Front Mission 3]].  In ASV2, hero of Cybernator (Assault Suit Valken), Jake (Full name: Jake Brain) makes a cameo appearance in the game as an NPC.  ==Trivia== {{Trivia|date=June 2007}}  * The game is labeled as one player, however you can control the enemies with the 2nd player controller. * Upon finishing the US version of Target Earth, the very final credit roll screen will show the Japanese name &quot;Assault Suits Leynos&quot;. * Unknown to the common public, Target Earth received a prequel that went by the name of Cybernator.  Cybernator was released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment system, which was one of the reasons why the games may have been considered separate entities.  The true game names made more sense though, with Target Earth's being &quot;Assault Suit Leynos&quot;, and Cybernator's being &quot;Assault Suit Valken&quot;.  Although the American names were different, the games possessed a lot of similarities.  Much of the mecha and technology seemed to have similar roots, as did the gameplay mechanics.  Both games were also story driven by way of text being displayed at the bottom of the screen entailing conversations between characters. Target Earth and Cybernator shared a number of common themes:  *Both featured variable weapons systems that the player could equip while on the fly.  Additionally, there was 360 degree (or close to it) aiming, and the ability to engage in aerial or Zero-G combat. *The enemy in both games was predominantly colored green. *Both games offered mission briefings and interaction/involvement with NPCs (Non-Player Characters).  This helped to convey the notion that the Player was involved in an actual war, and wasn't so much a one-man army.  Although simple in nature, the support of friendly mecha or a fly-by made by friendly aircraft served to help with immersion. *Both games pitted the protagonist against a formidable nemesis who would plague the Player until the final level. *The ending of both games brought about the destruction of the player's Assault Suit. *There were a number of instances involving similar levels:  Zero-G combat culminating in a battle with an enemy artillery-ship, a free fall drop to Earth with the Player fighting the enemy on the way down, Zero-G combat pitting the Player against massive enemy warships, underground assaults on enemy bases to destroy heavy/secret weapons, a final battle involving a confrontation with the &quot;nemesis&quot; and later the &quot;political leader&quot; of the enemy forces. *Certain scenes in the U.S. versions of both games were censored: in ''Target Earth'', the scene where a comrade doesn't make it back to the ship (and burns up in the atmosphere) was removed.  In ''Cybernator'', the scene where the enemy commander commits suicide after his defeat, was cut.  ==See also== * [[Armored Core]] * [[Front Mission]] * [[Heavy Gear]]  ==External links== *[http://www.ncs.co.jp/ NCS] *{{GameFAQs|type=/console/genesis|num=586520|name=''Target Earth''}} *[http://www2.odn.ne.jp/cbp50800/LEYNOS/LEYNOS_MAIN.HTML#index Target Earth Translation]  [[Category:1990 video games]] [[Category:Sega Mega Drive games]] [[Category:Virtual Console games]]  [[fr:Target Earth]] [[ja:重装機兵レイノス]]</text>     </revision>

It was released in [[Canterbury]], [[England]], on [[September 17]] [[2005]] by publisher [[Leonard Budd]].  Retired [[vicar]] Reverend [[Michael Hinton]] took about two years to condense the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]] to a pamphlet sized format with 58 pages.  {{Advert|date=October 2008}} It picks out the principal stories of the life and ministry of its central character, Jesus Christ. The social and theological context of these stories is provided by outlining the ups and downs of the history of his nation, Israel. It then proceeds to record the story of the growth of Christianity during the first century; firstly amongst the Jews themselves; then amongst the other peoples living in Israel and then throughout the eastern Mediterranean, even as far as Rome.  An example taken from the [[Sermon on the Mount]]: :''Much of Jesus’ teaching was brought together when, seated on a hillside, he spoke to his disciples about life in the kingdom of God. He taught that true happiness comes from having the right attitudes. Those who are humble, concerned about the world’s sinfulness, gentle, devoted to goodness, merciful, single-minded in God’s service, and peace-lovers will be blessed by God. Those of his followers who are persecuted in this world should rejoice, because they will have a rich reward in the next.''  == External links == * [http://www.the100-minutepress.co.uk/ Official site] * [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/kent/4756114.stm BBC News article]  &lt;br&gt;  [[Category:2005 books]] [[Category:Bible versions and translations]]  {{Christian-book-stub}}</text>     </revision>

The circular viewport was installed for display purposes.]] '''Bion 3''' ([[Cosmos (satellite)|Cosmos]] 782) was a [[Bion (satellite)|Bion satellite]]. It was the first joint [[United States|U.S.]]-[[Soviet]] biomedical research flight. It carried fourteen experiments prepared by seven countries in all, with participation from scientists in [[France]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], and [[Romania]].  It included a centrifuge with revolving and fixed sections in which identical groups of animals, plants, and cells could be compared. The subject animals included white rats and tortoises. The effects of aging on fruit fly livers and plant tissues with grafted cancerous growths were also studied.  Launched from [[Plesetsk]] on November 25, 1975, the biosatellite was recovered in [[Siberia]] on December 15. The mission ended after 19.5 days.  More than 20 different species were flown on the mission, incluing twenty-five unrestrained male [[Wistar rat]]s, fruit flies (''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''), carrot tissues, and 1000 embryos of the fish ''[[Fundulus heteroclitus]]'' (a small shallow water minnow). A U.S. radiation dosimeter experiment was also carried out without using biological materials. This was the only Bion mission where the United States provided some of the biological specimens.
