A 6'3&quot; 185-lb guard, Leonard played high school basketball at Terre Haute Gerstmeyer High School, where he excelled as a tennis player, as well.  He played collegiate basketball at [[Indiana University]], and was selected with the first pick of the second round of the [[1954 NBA Draft]].  He spent most of his seven-year professional playing career with the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] (four years in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], and one year following the team's move to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]), followed by two years with the [[Washington Wizards|Chicago Packers/Zephyrs]]).  In his final season as a player, he also [[player-coach|coached]] the Zephyrs.  The next year, the team moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]; Leonard coached them for one more year.  In 1969, Leonard became the coach of the [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Indiana Pacers]], a position he held for nearly 12 years &amp;ndash; the last four after the franchise moved to the [[NBA]]. Leonard led the Pacers to three ABA championships before the league's merger with the NBA.  Leonard returned to the Pacers in 1985 as a color commentator, first for television (WXIN-59 &amp; WTTV-4), then on radio, where he remains alongside Mark Boyle on [[WIBC (FM)|WIBC]] 1070-AM.  His trademark phrase (for successful three-point shots) is &quot;Boom, Baby!&quot;  == External links == *[http://www.basketball-reference.com/coaches/leonasl01c.html Basketball-Reference.com: Slick Leonard (as coach)]                *[http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/leonasl01.html Basketball-Reference.com: Slick Leonard (as player)] *[http://www.remembertheaba.com/TributeMaterial/Leonard.html Remember the ABA: Slick Leonard]  {{start box}} {{succession box | title=[[Washington Wizards|Chicago Zephyrs/Baltimore Bullets]] Head Coach | before=[[Jack McMahon]]| years=1963&amp;ndash;1964| after= [[Buddy Jeannette]] }} {{succession box | title=[[Indiana Pacers]] Head Coach | before=[[Larry Staverman]]| years=1968&amp;ndash;1980| after= [[Jack McKinney (basketball)|Jack McKinney]] }} {{end box}}  {{1954 NBA Draft}} {{WizardsCoach}} {{Indiana Pacers}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Leonard, Slick}} [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:1932 births]] [[Category:American basketball coaches]] [[Category:American basketball players]] [[Category:Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball players]] [[Category:Baltimore Bullets (1947-1955) draft picks]] [[Category:Minneapolis Lakers players]] [[Category:Los Angeles Lakers players]] [[Category:Chicago Packers expansion draft picks]] [[Category:Chicago Packers players]] [[Category:Chicago Zephyrs players]] [[Category:Chicago Zephyrs coaches]] [[Category:Baltimore Bullets coaches]] [[Category:Indiana Pacers coaches]] [[Category:Player-coaches]] [[Category:National Basketball Association broadcasters]]  [[fr:Bob Leonard]]</text>     </revision>

Peter Mueller was the first Olympic Champion on the 1000&amp;nbsp;m, when this distance was introduced at the [[1976 Winter Olympics]] in [[Innsbruck]]. More international successes followed at the [[World Sprint Speed Skating Championships|World Sprint Championships]], where he won bronze in 1976 and silver in 1977. His last appearance as a speed skater was at the [[1980 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], where he placed 5th in the 1000&amp;nbsp;m, 1.93 seconds behind the winning time of [[Eric Heiden]].  == Coaching ==  After ending his speed skating career, Mueller became a very successful skating coach. He was the coach of [[Bonnie Blair]] when she won two gold medals at the [[1992 Winter Olympics]], [[Dan Jansen]] when he won gold at the [[1994 Winter Olympics]], [[Marianne Timmer]] (two gold medals) and [[Jan Bos]] (silver) at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]], and [[Gianni Romme]] (silver) at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. In addition, several speed skaters winning a total of five World Sprint Championships, one [[World Allround Speed Skating Championships|World Allround Championships]], and one [[European Speed Skating Championships|European Allround Championships]] titles were also coached by him.  Since the 2003/2004 season, Mueller is the coach of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] team. He quickly added to his impressive list of successes as a coach when, at the [[World Single Distance Championships]] of 2005 in [[Inzell]], [[Even Wetten]] (on the 1000&amp;nbsp;m) and [[Rune Stordal]] (on the 1500&amp;nbsp;m) became World Champions.  == Private life ==  Mueller was married to American speed skater [[Leah Poulos]], two times World Sprint Champion and three times Olympic silver medalist, and had two children. Later, he married [[Netherlands|Dutch]] speed skater [[Marianne Timmer]]. He and Timmer are now divorced.

The radar site was operated by the 752nd Aircraft Control and Warning (AC&amp;W) squadron, starting in late [[1951]].  The unit operated and maintained an AN/CPS-6B radar at this site. In [[1958]] this radar was replaced by an AN/FPS-6. A second height-finder radar arrived a year later.   In [[1960]] Empire site began operating an AN/FPS-7 radar, and joined the SAGE system. One of the AN/FPS-6 height-finder radars was supplanted by an AN/FPS-26A in [[1963]].   In [[1964]] Empire site became an ADC/FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]]) Joint Surveillance System (JSS) site.  The 752nd Radar Squadron (SAGE) was deactivated in April [[1978]], and the AN/FPS-26A height-finder was decommissioned in this time frame. The FAA assumed control of the radar operations area except for the AN/FPS-6 height-finder radar (now modified to the AN/FPS-116 variant). The [[National Park Service]] assumed control of the rest of the property.   Circa [[1980]] or [[1981]], the AN/FPS-7 search radar was replaced by an FAA model ARSR-3 search radar. The AN/FPS-116 height-finder radar was removed circa [[1988]]. The ARSR-3 was replaced by an ARSR-4 in the late 1990’s.

The second opening features the [[DATS]] in their new attire, the Digivice Burst using the Air Signal, Ikuto and Falcomon, the Royal Knights, Masaru's father, BanchoLeomon, Masaru's dogtag enlarged, and heavily features the Mega leveled Digimon in action.  *In Japanese, the title is &quot;Digimon Savers&quot;. *In Japanese, the first opening song is called &quot;Gouing!Going!

Formed in [[Toronto]] in 1996, the band consists of [[Andre Ethier (musician)|Andre Ethier]] on vocals and [[guitar]]s, Matthew Carlson on guitar, [[trumpet]] and [[bass guitar|bass]], Chad Ross on guitar, bass and [[mandolin]], Jeremi Madsen on guitar, bass, [[saxophone]] and [[percussion]], Max McCabe-Lokos (using the [[stage name]] ''Age of Danger'') on [[piano]], [[Organ (music)|organ]] and percussion, and Andrew Gunn on guitar and [[drum]]s.  Originally formed as a one-off band for a friend's birthday party, the Snakes kept performing together and soon became a popular draw on Toronto's live music scene. After releasing several 7&quot; singles, the Deadly Snakes released their full-length debut album, ''Love Undone'', in 1999.   The band have toured both Canada and internationally, and have released three further albums. Their 2005 single &quot;Gore Veil&quot;, from the album ''Porcella'', was named the fifth best song of the year by [[CBC Radio 3]]. The album ''Porcella'' was subsequently shortlisted for the inaugural [[Polaris Music Prize]] in 2006.  The Snakes announced their amicable breakup in August 2006, and played their last show on [[August 26]], [[2006]] at the Silver Dollar Room.   [[Andre Ethier (musician)|Andre Ethier]] has ventured out as a solo artist and has released three albums.   ==Discography==  * ''[[Love Undone]]'' ([[Sympathy for the Record Industry]], 1999) * ''[[I'm Not Your Soldier Anymore]]'' ([[In the Red Records|In the Red]], 2001) * ''[[Ode to Joy (album)|Ode to Joy]]'' (In the Red, 2003) * ''[[Porcella]]'' ([[Paper Bag Records]], 2005)  ==External links== *&quot;[http://www.cbcradio3.com/issues/2005_01_28/index.cfm?page=20 Destination Unknown: The Deadly Snakes Cross Vast Musical Terrain]&quot; [[CBC Radio 3]] Live Concert Session * [http://www.newyorknighttrain.com/zine/news/2006/aug/0811.html 2006 article about the band and its demise] from NewYorkNightTrain.com  [[Category:Canadian indie rock groups|Deadly Snakes, The]] [[Category:2000s music groups|Deadly Snakes, The]] [[Category:Toronto musical groups|Deadly Snakes, The]] [[Category:Garage punk|Deadly Snakes]] [[Category:Sympathy for the Record Industry artists|Deadly Snakes]]</text>     </revision>

Calico firearms feature a top-mounted, [[helical]]-feed, high-capacity (50 or 100 round) [[magazine]] that ejects spent shells from a slot in the bottom, making a brass catcher more practical. Interestingly, the Calico 9 mm pistols, carbines and submachine guns use the [[Roller-delayed blowback]] principle which is famously used in the [[Heckler &amp; Koch]] series of firearms.  ==View== Although reviews of the product line were very favorable, Calico has yet to secure big military and law enforcement contracts. Sales were severely curtailed by the introduction of the [[Federal assault weapons ban]] in the 1990s which limited magazine capacity of newly made firearms to ten rounds. Now that that particular legislation has expired, Calico is producing firearms again. Calico weapons are sometimes seen in various movies &amp; science fiction films due to their futuristic appearance. Most notably, the [[Command &amp; Conquer]] series, the M951 (in-game GAU-3 Eliminator) as [[GDI]]'s basic infantry assualt rifle. The company tagline in the 1990s was ''A Revolution in Firepower!''.  ==Products== *.22 LR Pistols **[[Calico M100P|M-100P]] **M-110P *9mm Pistols **[[M950]] Liberty III *Carbines **M-900 **M-951 **[[Calico 960|M960]] **Liberty I and II *Sub-machineguns **M-750 **M-900A **M-950A *.22 LR Carbines **[[Calico M100|M-100]] **M-100S  ==References== * Modern Small Arms - Ian Hogg, ISBN 1-85841-075-4  ==External links== * [http://www.calicolightweaponsystems.com Calico Official Web Site] * [http://207.234.249.73/gunfax/calico/calico.htm Calico Fans Web Site (unofficial)] * [http://world.guns.ru/smg/smg57-e.htm Modern Firearms Calico SMGs site] * [http://notpurfect.com/calico/index.html Shooters Web Ring Calico Site]  [[Category:Firearms manufacturers in the United States]] [[Category:Companies based in Hillsboro, Oregon]]</text>     </revision>

It is located approximately 10 km north of [[Alzey]], and 20 km south-west of [[Mainz]].  Wörrstadt is the seat of the ''[[Verbandsgemeinde]]'' (&quot;collective municipality&quot;) [[Wörrstadt (Verbandsgemeinde)|Wörrstadt]].   == Geography == === Geographical position === Wörrstadt is surrounded by the typical Rhineland-Palatinate cultural landscape: Mostly there's intensive winegrowing, and in the less exposed areas agriculture. The Rhine Hessian landscape is mostly broached and the natural vegetation almost vanished. Wörrstadt presents a for Rhine Hessian distinctive feature: With the &quot;Neuborn&quot;, the municipality owns one of the very rare forests in this region. In this woodland exist many natural springs, whose water supplies the local swimming pool of the municipality, the &quot;Neubornbad&quot;.  The main locality lies on a rise, whereby very beautiful and impressive distant views are possible. From Wörrstadt you can see the &quot;Donnersberg&quot;, the &quot;Wißberg&quot;, as well as the &quot;Taunus&quot;. When the weather is good, you're even able to see the skyline of [[Frankfurt am Main]] at multiple bounds.  The district [[Rommersheim]], former &quot;Eichloch&quot;, lies in a dip and merges imposing into the cultural landscape. At the bound Rommersheim, you're able to enjoy nice views at the Wißberg and into the direction of [[Bad Kreuznach]].  === Neighbour Townships === *[[Saulheim]] *[[Sulzheim]] *[[Gabsheim]] *[[Udenheim]] *[[Schornsheim]] *[[Armsheim]] *[[Gau-Bickelheim]] *[[Gau-Weinheim]] *[[Wallertheim]] *[[Spiesheim]] *[[Ensheim]] *[[Vendersheim]]  == History == === Personalities === [[Adam Elsheimer]], a German painter of the 17th century was born in Wörrstadt. The &quot;Adam-Elsheimer-Straße&quot; is called after him. His parents moved to [[Frankfurt]], so it's discussed if Elsheimer was born in Wörrstadt or in [[Frankfurt]].  Also out of Wörrstadt is the town chronicler [[Nikolaus von Wörrstadt]] (or [[Nicolaus von Werstad]]), that lead in 1428 a rebillion against the patricians, to prevent the town going bankrupt. Later he was captured in [[Straßburg]] by the presumable inventer of the letterpress printing [[Johannes Gutenberg]].  The [[geologist]] and [[impact event]] scientist Dr. [[Günther Graup]] (+2006), who among other things made a name for himself with the exploration of the [[Nördlinger Ries]]. His innovative works helped to understand the Ries-Happening better. He was also involved into the [[apollo program]] and inspected multiple moon-samples ([[Apollo 14]] and [[Apollo 16]]).  === Annexation === * district Rommersheim In 824 B.C., Rommersheim was documentary mentioned the first time. First Rommersheim was called &quot;Eichloch&quot;, before it got changed. The reason for the change was, that &quot;Eichloch&quot; sounded similar to the cuss word &quot;Arschloch&quot;(Asshole). In the 70s it got suburbanized into the municipality Wörrstadt, and is hereby also part of the homonymous collective municipality.  === Associate township === * [[Arney-le-Duc]], [[France]], since 1986  == Politics == === District Council === [[CDU]], [[SPD]], [[Grüne]], [[FWG]], [[BfW]]  === Mayor === * Günther Helmus - SPD (1984 - 2004) * Ingo Kleinfelder - SPD (2004 - today)  == Culture ==  === Places of Interest === * Former [[Thurn und Taxis|Thurn-und-Taxis]]-postal office * Laurentius- Church, containing a genuine Stumm- Organ from 1759 * Neunröhren- Fountain, built in 1608.

The term '''analogue''' is used in [[literary history]] in two related senses: * a work which resembles another in terms of one or more [[Motif (literature)|motif]]s, [[Fictional character|characters]], scenes, phrases or events. * an individual motif, character, scene, event or phrase which resembles one found in another work.  Similarities may be fortuitous, in which case the merit of establishing an analogue is that it makes it possible to see how works from different authors (perhaps also in different languages, periods, genres) treat similar characters or motifs. But the term is used  particularly in the study of [[legend]]s, [[folk tale]]s and [[oral literature]] for works that have features in common either because they derive from a shared tradition or because they both rework material from a specific older text, which may or may not still survive.  For example, the [[Deluge (mythology)|Deluge]] stories in the [[Bible]] and the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] are analogues.   However, where one work draws directly on another, the term ''analogue'' is inappropriate: the earlier work is the ''source'' of the later.   In the literature of earlier periods, it may not be easy to decide whether a particular work is a direct source for another, especially if there are uncertainties of dating. The phrase ''sources and analogues'' is used to cover ''all'' material relevant to the creation of a particular work.

It is run over a distance of 2 miles (3,219 metres) on the Old Course at [[Cheltenham Racecourse]], and it takes place annually during the [[Cheltenham Festival]] in March. There are twelve fences to be jumped in the race.  It was given its present name in 1969 to honour the racehorse [[Arkle]], a three-time winner of the [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]]. Prior to this the race had been known as the '''Cotswold Chase'''.  Since 1991 six winners of the race have gone on to win the [[Queen Mother Champion Chase]], while a further five winners have been placed. This contrasts heavily with the situation beforehand, when [[Flyingbolt]] was the only winner to subsequently win the Champion Chase. The 1979 winner passed the post first in the following year's Champion Chase only to be disqualified some time after the event because of a positive drugs test.  ==Winners== * ''Amateur jockeys indicated by &quot;Mr&quot;.'' {| class = &quot;sortable&quot;

It was the site of the [[Freestyle Skiing]] events of the [[2006 Olympic Winter Games]].  Together with the villages of [[Sestriere]], [[Claviere]], [[Cesana Torinese]], [[San Sicario]] and [[Mongenèvre]], in [[France]], it makes up the [[Via Lattea]] (Milky Way) skiing area.  Since the beginning of the 19th century, Sauze d'Oulx has been the exclusive destination for the [[Turin]] aristocracy, with its famous winter resort Sportinia and is still a skiing favourite because of its natural location.  Sauzed'olux is a very lively resort, and is popular with younger skiers and snowboarders.  It features runs for participants of all levels, as well as a great apres-ski, boasting a huge number of bars and restaurants.  For years it has been a favourite destination for English skiers, who represent more than 70% of the tourism and who have now become part of the resident population.    &lt;BR&gt; {{Province of Turin}}  {{coord|45|02|N|6|51|E|display=title}}  [[Category:2006 Winter Olympics venues]]  {{Turin-geo-stub}}  [[de:Sauze d’Oulx]] [[eo:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[fr:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[id:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[it:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[nl:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[ja:サウゼ・ドゥルクス]] [[nap:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[no:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[pms:Sauze d'Ols]] [[pl:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[pt:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[sl:Sauze D'Oulx]] [[fi:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[sv:Sauze d'Oulx]] [[vo:Sauze d'Oulx]]</text>     </revision>

The [[Review Body]] invites evidence from a range of stakeholders, including the [[British Medical Association|BMA]] and the government, and then decides how much doctors' pay should increase in the following year.  In principle the DDRB matches doctors' pay with others doing similar jobs in the public and private sector, and ensures that doctors' pay continues to match that of others doing comparable jobs, and on comparable incomes. In practice it has been suggested that the DDRB has failed to maintain doctors' incomes in line with others, partly because of pressure from the treasury, and partly because the government has refused to fully meet the DDRB recommendations. There is evidence that doctors' income has been falling over many years. [http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/331/7531/1520 McManus IC.

The system has four passenger stations and a maintenance &amp; control centre, and is run by two cars, one for each route. The system uses [[automated guideway transit]] technology, although for the moment it is driven manually, and exists primarily for the benefit of office workers and a few local residents.  ==History== [[Image:Las Colinas APT System 1.jpg|thumb|right|The APT system in action. Here, the people mover is just outside Bell Tower Station.]] The community of Las Colinas was founded in 1973, but construction of the APT did not begin until 1979. The first phase construction contained 1.4 miles of guideway and four stations.&lt;ref name=jonbell&gt;{{cite web| url=http://web.presby.edu/~jtbell/transit/Irving/| work=Jon Bell's Transit Pages| title=Las Colinas Peoplemover (APT)| }}&lt;/ref&gt; (At this time, Phase 1 remains the only fully constructed and operational track: see [[Las Colinas APT System#Current Operation|Current Operation]] for more details.)  Although the guideways were in place by 1983, the system was not finalised and opened until 1986, following the purchase of four cars, power and control infrastructure from [[AEG|AEG-Westinghouse]],&lt;ref name=jonbell /&gt; which has since been purchased by [[Bombardier]].&lt;ref name=dcurd&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dcurd.com/| title=Dallas County Utility and Reclamation District| }}&lt;/ref&gt; Passenger service began three years later, on [[18 June]] [[1989]], with the first five years of operation to be overseen by the vendor.&lt;ref name=jonbell /&gt; This was part of a deal that reportedly cost $45 million.&lt;ref name=facilities&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.facilities.ufl.edu/cp/pdf/PeopleMovers.pdf| format=PDF| author=Tzveta Panayotova (Facilities Planning and Construction UFL)| title=People Movers - Systems and Case Studies| }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 1993, the system was closed due to rising expenses and a lack of demand. Obviously, plans for future expansion were put on hold, not just because of the low demand for the current system, but because the real estate crash in the Dallas area in the mid-1980s had reduced demand for development in the rest of Las Colinas.  Las Colinas saw a revival of fortune towards the latter half of the 1990s, and the system reopened accordingly in December 1996. Rising occupancy rates in the area saw a renewed call for expansion, but the current system still runs only on a limited basis.&lt;ref name=jerryschneider&gt;{{cite web| url=http://faculty.washington.edu/jbs/itrans/lascol.htm| work=Jerry Schneider's Innovative Transportation Technologies| title=Las Colinas Peoplemover Infopage| }}&lt;/ref&gt;  == Operations ==  {| {{Railway line header}} {{BS-table}} {{BS3|uKBFa-ELEV||||Xerox Center}} {{BS3|uELEV|uKBFa-ELEV|||Lincoln Place}} {{BS3|uELEV|uWBRÜCKE-ELEV|||Lake Carolyn}} {{BS3|uABZrg-ELEV|uSTRrf-ELEV||}} {{BS3|uBHF-ELEV||||Bell Tower}} {{BS3|uBHF-ELEV||||Cigna Tower}} {{BS3|uKDSe||||Maintenance and Control Center}} |} |}  Since the 1996 reopening, the system has been run by the ''Dallas County Utility and Reclamation District''. It runs from 10:30am to 2pm on weekdays, mostly for the benefit of office workers riding to Bell Tower Station to eat lunch at the restaurants located there.&lt;ref name=jerryschneider /&gt;  The system is operated manually, with only two trains running as demand dictates. The drivers use a small control panel that is equipped with an emergency and maintenance controls.   ===Track Routing===  The initial track layout has not changed since Phase 1 was opened in 1986. There are two tracks.  *'''Track 1''' - This track forks north at Bell Tower and ends at Xerox Center (aka Millennium Center). *'''Track 2''' - This track forks east at Bell Tower and ends at Lincoln Place (aka Equity Offices).  ===Stations===  The four original stations and maintenance center are still the only operational stopping points for passengers on the APT system. These stations are:  *'''Maintenance and Control Center''' - Not used by passengers, each train starts its first morning journey here. The control centre is manned by an overseer during times of operation. *'''Cigna Tower''' - On both tracks 1 and 2, this is located at 600 E. Las Colinas Boulevard. *'''Bell Tower''' - The main station at 27 Mandalay Canal, this is accessible on both tracks, and is located above the Mandalay Canal. The numerous dining options, as well as the Tower's central location within Las Colinas, makes this the most popular station with both local workers and visitors. *'''Lincoln Place''' - Located at the end of Track 2, and also known as Equity Offices at 909 E. Las Colinas Boulevard. This stop is mostly used by office workers in that building. *'''Xerox Center''' - Also known as Millennium Center, this forms the terminus for Track 1.&lt;ref name=dcurd /&gt;  ===Vehicles=== Out of the four vehicles purchased in 1986, only two are used on day-to-day service.  ==Future Expansion==  Plans to expand the system have existed since the inception of the APT; a number of guideway pillars without tracks already exist north of the Xerox Center station. Track 2 has enough space for two lines, although currently only one is placed on the guideways.  ==Controversy==  Some, such as [[Gary N. Bourland]], author of ''Las Colinas: The Inside Story of America's Premier Urban Development'', cite cases of the APT System being viewed as an expensive [[white elephant]].&lt;ref name=happyme&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.happyme.com/las_colinas.htm| author=Gary N. Bourland| publisher=Happyme Publishing| title=Las Colinas: The Inside Story of America's Premier Urban Development| id=ISBN 0960935037 | }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been cited as one of the contributors towards the high rate of taxation in the Las Colinas area.&lt;ref name=foxglen&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxglen.org/LCHistory.htm| author=Lee Powell| publisher=The Dallas Morning News| title=Ranch to riches: A city's tale - Las Colinas' growth marked by foresight, careful planning| }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Northwest Corridor Major Investment Study - carried out on behalf of the [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] Board of Directors - sees the potential to integrate the APT system into the DART public transit network, showing that some demand remains for the service's continuation and even expansion.&lt;ref name=irvinglanduse&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ci.irving.tx.us/economic_development/Land_Use_Study/part2.asp| author=City of Irving| title=Northwest Corridor Land Use Study| }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ==References== {{Reflist}}  {{USpplmver}}  [[Category:Rapid transit in the United States]]</text>     </revision>

Since the introduction of the [[Principal Officials Accountability System]] on [[July 1st]], [[2002]], secretaries of departments and secretaries of bureaux (but not the other five officials) are political appointees. Before that all principal officials were civil servants. The civil servants who held the positions of secretaries of bureaux have their titles changed to permanent secretaries, and are no longer principal officials.  ==List== *Secretaries of departments **[[Chief Secretary for Administration]] **[[Financial Secretary (Hong Kong)|Financial Secretary]] **[[Secretary for Justice]] *Deputy secretaries of departments **''None'' *Secretaries of Bureaux  **[[Secretary for the Civil Service]] **[[Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology|Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development]]  **[[Secretary for Constitutional Affairs|Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs]]   **[[Secretary for Economic Development and Labour|Secretary for Development]] **[[Secretary for Education and Manpower|Secretary for Education]] **[[Secretary for the Environment, Transport and Works|Secretary for the Environment]] **[[Secretary for the Environment, Transport and Works|Secretary for Transport and Housing]] **[[Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury]] **[[Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food|Secretary for Food and Health]] **[[Secretary for Home Affairs]] **[[Secretary for Labour and Welfare]] **[[Secretary for Security]] *Directors of Bureaux **[[Commissioner, Independent Commission Against Corruption]] **[[Director of Audit]] **[[Commissioner of Police]]  **[[Director of Immigration]]  **[[Commissioner of Customs and Excise]]  ==External links== *[http://www.gov.hk/en/about/govdirectory/po/index.htm Principal Officials of the Hong Kong SAR government] *[http://www.info.gov.hk/basic_law/fulltext/content0204.htm Chapter IV: Political Structure - Basic Law] *[http://www.info.gov.hk/info/name-e.htm Who's Who]  {{HK Principal Officials}}  [[category:Hong Kong Government]] [[category:Hong Kong-related lists]]</text>     </revision>

It was founded by Thomas Hope Robinson in [[1883]] and has been in continual publication ever since, adding an internet and email daily news service in [[1996]]. The company began publishing directories in the 1960s, which led to a joint venture with [[Lloyd's Register]] in 2001, now known as Lloyd's Register - Fairplay Ltd.   It's believed Thomas Hope Robinson was a merchant seaman who turned his hand to publishing on coming ashore in the UK.  In the first issue he wrote: &quot;There is so little Fairplay in the world.  If our own efforts succeed, we shall have taken the first steps towards promoting the habit of calling things by their right name and looking at them through uncoloured spectacles.&quot;  This &quot;raison d'etre&quot; has appeared in every subsequent issue of Fairplay magazine, an archive of which is available to view at the company headquarters.  The organisation is based in [[Redhill, Surrey]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] and has offices in America, Singapore, Sweden and a network of correspondents world-wide.  == External links == {{nautical portal}} *[http://www.fairplay.co.uk Fairplay] *[http://www.lrfairplay.com Lloyd's Register - Fairplay]  [[Category:Business magazines]] [[Category:Boat magazines]] [[Category:Merchant marine]]</text>     </revision>

Play was suspended through [[World War I]] and after the war, in [[1919]], they merged with another football side, ''FC Teutonia''. The following year, the winter sports club ''Wintersportverein Steinach'' also joined and remained part of the club until [[1926]]. From [[1933]] to [[1936]], ''Steinach'' played in the [[Gauliga Mitte]], one of sixteen regional leagues formed through the reorganization of German football under the [[Third Reich]]. They finished second in this league in 1933-34, were relegated in [[1937]] and returned for a season in [[1939]] before sitting out for the duration of [[World War II]]. The club resumed play in [[East Germany|East Germany's]] Bezirksliga Suhl in [[1952]] as ''BSG Motor Steinach''. Through the late 50's and early 60's the team bounced up and down between the second and third division Liga and 2.Liga. They earned promotion to the top-flight DDR Oberliga where they played the [[1964]] and [[1965]] seasons before falling back. With [[German re-unification]] in 1990 the club took on the name ''SV 08 Steinach'' and plays today in the Landesliga Thüringen (V).  ''Steinach'' has a number of other sports departments and offers its members winter sports, bowling, table tennis, volleyball, gymnastics aund Tae Kwon Do.  ==External links== *[http://www.sv08-steinach.de/ Official team site]  {{fb start}} {{Landesliga Thüringen}} {{fb end}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Steinach}} [[Category:German football clubs]] [[Category:East German football clubs]] [[Category:Thuringia football clubs]] [[Category:Football (soccer) clubs established in 1908]]  [[de:SV 08 Steinach]]</text>     </revision>

The song was produced by Rohan &quot;Snowcone&quot; Fuller and received a positive reception from music [[critic]]s. The song was released as the second U.S. [[single (music)|single]] in the first quarter of 2006 and reached number one in the [[United States]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and became Paul's third number one hit single. It reached the top ten in [[Canada]] and [[France]] and the top twenty in the [[United Kingdom]], peaking at #11 there. In [[Australia]], &quot;Temperature&quot; debuted at number nineteen but quickly found its way to number five the following weeks.   &quot;Temperature&quot; became [[Sean Paul]]'s biggest hit single in the US. In Australia it became a smash hit, with Sean Paul making interview appearances on the Paul Celoni Radio Show, and shows alike. Even though it only spent one week at #1, as opposed to &quot;Get Busy&quot; and its three weeks on top, &quot;Temperature&quot; showed extreme longevity on The [[Billboard Hot 100]] spending 17 weeks in the top 10. Until [[Nelly Furtado]] and [[Timbaland]]'s &quot;[[Promiscuous (song)|Promiscuous]], this was the longest run in the top ten for a single in 2006. On top of that it became Sean Paul's first single to sell an excess of one million digital downloads . However, as of January 2006 is still only certified gold for this achievement.  The song uses the dancehall [[riddim]] &quot;Applause&quot;.  It was also used in the game ''[[Dance Dance Revolution SuperNOVA 2]]''.  Officially, there are two versions of the song. Only the use of the riddim makes both versions different.  It can be heard in the 2007 film, ''[[Norbit]]''.  ==Music video== [[Image:TemperatureVideo.png|thumb|left|The winter sequence from the music video.]]  In this video Sean Paul is seen dancing quite close with female dancers. The first dance sequence was with blowing leaves, centered in fall. Then as weather gets colder, he is in the snow with the [[thermometer]] frozen, centered in winter. The third sequence is in the rain, centered around spring. Finally he's at a tanning salon squirting sunscreen, centered around summer.

There are 3,000 working men's clubs in the UK. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmciu.org.uk/MANAGEMENT.htm] {{Dead link|date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  == Purpose == Despite the educational ambitions, most working men's clubs are recreational. Typically, clubs have a bar, [[snooker]] or [[eight-ball|pool]] tables, and many provide food. They often provide entertainment such as [[Bingo (UK)|bingo]], [[raffle]]s, live music and comedy.   == Membership and structure == A working men's club is a non-profit organisation run by members through a committee, usually elected annually. Each club has rules which tend to be vigorously enforced. The committee will discipline members (common punishments being a warning, or a ban for a period) for violations. Despite the name, women are allowed to be members in many clubs, and all clubs allow entry to women. Non-members are not allowed entry unless signed in by a member.  While all members pay an annual fee, the primary income comes from alcohol. A club will retain paid staff, such as barmen, stewards, caretakers and cleaners.  == Club and Institute Union == Most clubs affiliate to the [[Working Men's Club and Institute Union]] (commonly known as the CIU or C&amp;IU).  The CIU is affiliated to the Committee of Registered Clubs Associations or [[CORCA]]. A member of one affiliated club is entitled to use the facilities of other clubs.  The CIU has two purposes; to provide a national voice  for clubs, and to provide discounted products and services for clubs.  === Brewery === Until 2004, the CIU ran a brewery in [[Dunston, Tyne and Wear]]. This produced ales and lagers under the Federation brand. The brewery and brands were sold to [[Scottish &amp; Newcastle]] for £16.2M &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.s-n.com/sn_acq/ir/finnews/rnsitem?id=1089792001nRNSN8162A | title=Scottish &amp; Newcastle – Financial News | publisher=Scottish &amp; Newcastle plc | date=2004-07-14 | accessdate=2008-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, although CIU clubs still receive discounted beer. These discounts are passed to members.  == Impact of July 2007 smoking ban == In December 2007 a poll by the ''British Institute of Innkeeping'' and the ''Federation of Licensed Victuallers' Associations'' found that overall revenue was 7.3% down as more men opted to drink at home where they could also smoke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Working men's clubs hardest hit by smoking ban | work=[[Daily Telegraph]] | date=2007-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  == References == &lt;references/&gt;  [[Category:Clubs and societies]]</text>     </revision>

The country went by the abbreviation ''ENG'' and used the [[St George's Cross]] as flag and [[Land of Hope and Glory]] as the [[national anthem]].  Diver [[Tony Ally]] bore England's flag at the opening ceremony whilst shooter [[Mick Gault]] bore the flag during the closing ceremony, both chosen by a vote of England  team managers from a list of nominations.  ==Expectations== England entered these Games, held in [[Melbourne]]; [[Australia]], after playing hosts to the [[2002 Commonwealth Games|previous Games]] in [[Manchester]] in Manchester 2002. The medal tally was not expected to be a large as at the 2002 Games, where England had a home advantage and achieved a total of 166 medals including 54 Gold, 51 Silver and 60 Bronze to finish in second place behind Australia. A strong second place in the medal tally was, however, still expected.  The country sent a large team, with competitors taking part in every sport in the schedule. The largest teams were sent in athletics and swimming and it was in these sports, along with cycling and shooting that the team hoped to win most medals.

It is located 27 km south of the town of [[Peace River, Alberta|Peace River]], along [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway 2]].  ==Demographics== According to the 2006 census, Nampa has a:  *population of 360 living in 168 [[house|dwellings]], a 3.2% decrease from 2001 *land area of {{km2 to mi2|1.86|abbr=yes|wiki=yes}}  *and a [[population density]] of {{Pop density km2 to mi2|193.8| spell=UK | abbr=yes}}.&lt;ref name=statcan2006&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;Code1=4817039&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=48&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Nampa&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=All&amp;GeoLevel=&amp;GeoCode=4817039 | title= Nampa - Community Profile | author= Statistics Canada| authorlink= Statistics Canada| year= [[Canada 2006 Census|Census 2006]] | accessdate= 2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ==History== *1916: Originally the area was known as &quot;Tank&quot; named after the water tank and pump house built by the railway when it arrived. *1924: The first post office is opened.  It was later decided a new name should be given to the community. An aboriginal leader came up with the current name of &quot;Nampa&quot;. Nampa means &quot;the place&quot; in aboriginal. Nampa is also the name of a community in Idaho.  ==Economy== The principal industries in the area are agriculture, forestry, oil and gas.  One of the largest employers of the area is Boucher Brothers Lumber Mill located just outside the village, about a 3 kilometers northwest of Nampa. This mill employed approximately 56 people and ships lumber to a number of different areas. It has been in the area since the 1980s. In April 2008, Boucher Brothers laid off 28 people because of the poor [[United States]] housing market, softwood tariff, and the increasing [[Canadian]] [[dollar]].&lt;ref&gt;Justin Pot,&quot;[http://cgi.bowesonline.com/pedro.php?id=15&amp;x=story&amp;xid=390869 Record-Gazette],&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Northern Forage located on the west side of town compresses hay bails that are shipped to Japan. This business also has a number of employees.  Farmers from around the community come to Nampa to deliver their grain at the Great Northern Grain Terminals, located at the north side of town. From here the grain is shipped to [[Falher, Alberta]] which is 35 km south of Nampa. Besides raising [[cattle]] some farmers have herds of [[buffalo]].  ==Events and Attractions== The Annual Farmers Day and Family Fair is held in mid June each year in Nampa. The Heart River Golf Club holds its annual open in mid July. In the winter months, many look forward to the Family Day events in February, a day filled with [[snowshoeing]], hayrides, free [[skating]], [[curling]] and [[hotdogs]] is enjoyed by all ages.  ==See also== *[[List of communities in Alberta]] *[[Villages of Alberta]]  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{Subdivisions of Alberta|villages=yes}}  [[Category:Villages in Alberta]]  {{Alberta-geo-stub}}</text>     </revision>

The bill was passed in the wake of a number of [[Controversies about the Boy Scouts of America|controversies involving the Boy Scouts of America]], such as their exclusion of gays and atheists, and subsequent attempts to limit government support of the organization. ==Legislative language== In particular, the bill states: *''No Federal law... shall be construed to limit any Federal agency from providing any form of support for a youth organization (including the Boy Scouts of America or any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America)that would result in that Federal agency providing less support to that youth organization... than was provided during the preceding fiscal year.''  *''The Secretary of Defense shall provide at least the same level of support under this section for a national or world Boy Scout Jamboree as was provided under this section for the preceding national or world Boy Scout Jamboree.''  *''No State or unit of general local government that has a designated open forum, limited public forum, or nonpublic forum and that is a recipient of assistance under this title shall deny equal access or a fair opportunity to meet to, or discriminate against, any youth organization, including the Boy Scouts of America or any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America, that wishes to conduct a meeting or otherwise participate in that designated open forum, limited public forum, or nonpublic forum.''  In July 2005, the Senate voted 98 to 0 to include the bill in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 (H.R.1815, Sec. 1058){{ref|Bill}}, which was signed into law on December 30, 2005. {{ref|BSALegal}}   ==Impact== It is unknown what the ultimate effects of this act will be on the on-going [[Boy Scouts of America membership controversies|controversy regarding governmental support of the Boy Scouts]].

An instructive but obsolete route to Cp* complexes involves the use of hexamethyl [[Dewar benzene]].

Organotransition Metal Chemistry: Fundamental Concepts and Applications. (1986) p. 105 &lt;/ref&gt;  Relative to the more common cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligand, pentamethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp*) offers certain features that are often advantageous.  Being more electron-rich, Cp* is a stronger donor and is less easily removed from the metal.  Consequently its complexes exhibit increased thermal stability.  Its steric bulk allows the isolation of complexes with fragile ligands.   Its bulk also attenuates intermolecular interactions, decreasing the tendency to form polymeric structures.  Its complexes also tend to be highly soluble in non-polar solvents.  ==See also== * [[Methylcyclopentadiene]]  ==References== {{reflist}} &lt;!-- relevance?

Directed by [[Tomás Gutiérrez Alea]], the story is based on a novel by [[Edmundo Desnoes]]. It was Alea's fifth film, and probably his most famous worldwide. The film gathered several awards at international film festivals.  ==Story==  Sergio, a wealthy bourgeois aspiring writer, decides to stay in Cuba even though his wife and friends flee to Miami. Sergio looks back over the changes in Cuba, from the [[Cuban Revolution]] to the [[Cuban missile crisis|missile crisis]], the effect of living in an [[underdevelopment|underdeveloped]] country, and his relations with his girlfriends Elena and Hanna. ''Memories of Underdevelopment'' is a complex character study of alienation during the turmoil of social changes. The film is told in a highly subjective point of view through a fragmented narrative that remembles the way memories function.   ==See also== {{portalpar|Cuba|Flag of Cuba.svg}} *[[Cinema of Cuba]]  ==External links== *{{imdb title | id=0063291 | name=Memorias del Subdesarrollo}} * [http://film.guardian.co.uk/Century_Of_Films/Story/0,,140598,00.html Derek Malcolm of the Guardian places &quot;Memorias del Subdesarrollo&quot; at number 54 in his 100 greatest movies]  {{CinemaofCuba}}  [[Category:Cuban films]] [[Category:1968 films]] [[Category:Spanish-language films]]  [[es:Memorias del Subdesarrollo]]</text>     </revision>

Axenrot played with [[Opeth]] on their last five tours, filling in for then drummer [[Martin Lopez]]. On [[May 12]], [[2006]], he officially joined the band as Lopez left permanently. Axenrot has been jokingly been referred to as the ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' character [[Legolas]] by band members and fans. &quot;He's kind of pretty, looks like [[Legolas]],&quot; remarked [[Mikael Åkerfeldt]] who has also named him, &quot;the most confused man I have ever met&quot;. On Blabbermouth.com Åkerfeldt also said that Axenrot completed his drumming part for eleven tracks on the new Opeth album 'Watershed' in just seven days. In an interview, Martin said, &quot;Rudiments and technique in general were encouraged by my drum teacher Stig Bendric, who has passed away now, but had always played in the army and with the Norrköping Symphonic Orchestra. He was a huge [[Buddy Rich]] fan, and could play really impressive stuff. It made me appreciate the sense of swing when playing&quot;.  He is currently dating Nathalie Lorichs who contributed vocals on Coil from Opeth's [[Watershed (Opeth album)|Watershed]] and they both work together on a project with Axenrot on guitars.  == External links == * [http://www.drummerszone.com/artists/artist.php?artistNR=f009a3e60e083d7a655119e0aa40b947 Biography at drummerszone.com] * [http://www.drummerszone.com/news/newsItem.php?n01ID=2425&amp;type=5 Interview by drummerszone.com]  {{DEFAULTSORT:Axenrot, Martin}} {{drummer-stub}}  {{Opeth}} {{blo}} [[Category:1979 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Opeth members]] [[Category:Swedish heavy metal drummers]]  [[es:Martin Axenrot]] [[it:Martin Axenrot]] [[pl:Martin Axenrot]] [[fi:Martin Axenrot]] [[sv:Martin Axenrot]]</text>     </revision>

It originally aired on [[May 7]], [[2006]].  ==Plot== Looking for a way to get easy money, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]], and [[Nelson Muntz|Nelson]] go around town spray-painting people’s addresses on their curbs and making them pay them ten dollars for the unsolicited service. It turns out to be a success after all, but after they already add the “7” and the “4” to the Simpsons’ curb, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] tells them that he won’t pay, so they leave without finishing. The next day, the letter carrier delivers them someone else’s mail, thinking that their address is 74 Evergreen Terrace. Homer continues to accept the mail. He gets steaks from Omaha, and even accepts a wedding invitation to Scott Weingarten’s cousin’s wedding (although he doesn't know that Scott is a blind rich man). One day, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] gets a letter claiming that she has won a contest from a magazine she doesn’t even subscribe to. Her prize is that a maid will clean the house for a day while she relaxes. Not wanting to look bad, Marge cleans the house until it’s entirely spotless. That is, except for a small stain on the kitchen floor. She combines all of her different cleaners together, but the fumes make her woozy. She falls and hits her head on a stool. When she wakes up in the hospital, it is revealed that she has [[amnesia]] and can’t even remember her own family.  After the insurance coverage runs out, the family returns home, with Marge still having amnesia. The home environment quickly jogs her memory of her children, and she also recognizes [[Ned Flanders]] when he appears at the window, but Homer is still a stranger to her since the remembrance of Ned block Homer's memory.  Homer tries to get her to remember him, but to no avail. He shows Marge the family album, even telling her &quot;Here's me beating up former President Bush, and here's me beating up current President Bush&quot; while showing her pictures of the events. He then decides to try to make her fall in love with him again, but he only makes her disgusted in him, saying that the greatest thing that’s ever happened to her was forgetting about him since Homer says that they had first been making love on a golf course. Marge says that she isn't a kind of girl who will make love on a golf course (later there is seen that [[Principal Skinner]] and [[Edna Krabappel]] had been making love in that same golf course). She kicks him out of the house. Then Homer moves to the Springfield retirement castle to [[Abe Simpson|his father]], who asks him that how long Homer stays there, and Homer answers that he will stay at least to the death of Abe. [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Patty and Selma]] excitedly take Marge to a speed dating event, and she meets a man who shares her interests. But Lenny and Carl had called Homer and told him that Marge is dating an other guy. Homer quickly goes there. When Marge tells him that she has amnesia and three kids, he leaves her. Homer catches up with him and scolds him for leaving her, saying that she is the most beautiful and kind woman he’ll ever meet. Still, he leaves. Marge then tells Homer that even though she may not remember him, he knows the most wonderful things about her. As they drive back home, Homer brings up beer, and she suddenly remembers him. The episode ends with Homer and Marge driving into the sunset. During the credits, Homer is asking Marge if she knows any of the people listed.  ==Cultural references== *The scene where Marge and Homer go to a wedding uninvited is similar to various scenes from ''[[Wedding Crashers]]''. *Homer writes on the sidewalk that the [[1974 Oakland Athletics season|’74 Oakland A's]] are the best team ever. Soon after, several members of the team drive by and thank Homer for remembering them. [[Sal Bando]] and [[Gene Tenace]], two members of the actual team, make cameo appearances. *Marge’s quote, “''Et tu'', Zud?” is a reference to “''[[Et tu, Brute?]]''” from ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' by [[Shakespeare]]. *The title of this episode is a reference to ''[[Regarding Henry]]'', which revolves around Harrison Ford's character recovering from amnesia and brain damage.  {{wikiquote|The_Simpsons#Regarding_Margie_.5B17.20.5D|“Regarding Margie”}} {{portal|The Simpsons}}  [[Category:The Simpsons episodes, season 17]] [[Category:2006 television episodes]]  [[es:Regarding Margie]] [[fr:À propos de Marge]]</text>     </revision>

Frasier mentions in passing that schools often give teenagers who want to be a parent a bag of flour to look after and watch for a week, and Niles takes the idea seriously and decides to try it. Over the week, the baby is bumped, soaked, set on fire, poked with a chopstick, and finally gored by Eddie the dog.  Meanwhile, Frasier is asked to sign a card for a work colleague. He jokingly writes &quot;Dear Clarence, you're not getting older, you're just getting closer to death&quot;, before finding to his horror that the card is not for a birthday; Clarence has had a [[kidney transplantation|kidney transplant]]. To avoid embarrassment he has to buy the exact same card, sneak into the hospital to get the old one back, and recreate everyone else's messages letter-for-letter. When returning the card he sees Clarence, who is delighted that Frasier &quot;went to the trouble to visit when the rest of those bums didn't even send me a card&quot;.  ==Episode Title Cards== *''Special delivery'' *''Flour child'' *''No guts, no glory''  ==Memorable Quotations== ''Frasier is attempting to reassure a taxi driver in [[childbirth|labour]].

If we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it right. ''(finds the flour, reads)'' “Bleached, 100% fat free, best when kept in an airtight container”.

Here is an excerpt from &quot;Darksword Adventures&quot; by Weis and Hickman which describes Simkin's origin: &quot;Joram makes two observations about Simkin: first, that Simkin plays the game for the game's sake, and second, that he is magic personified.&quot;  His knowledge of everyone and everything that occurs in the world makes him a player in every event from the most mundane to matters that the very world depends on.  He is amoral, self-absorbed, unfeeling yet handsome (when he is not a garishly colored teapot), charming and extremely funny.  ==Characteristics== Simkin is often referred to as &quot;the fool&quot;.  His known abilities are to shape change into anything at all at a whim.  He can also cast various  powerful spells.  The character has little to no concern over what happens to the people around him and enjoys causing chaos just to see what will happen.  ==Other Occurrences== &quot;Simkin&quot; is a common nickname chosen by many net geeks on various chat and gaming servers.  &quot;Simkin&quot; is also a high-level lightweight embeddable scripting language which works with Java or C++ and XML.  ==External links== * [http://www.simkin.co.uk Simkin homepage]  [[Category:Characters in written fantasy]]</text>     </revision>

There is no copyvio here, as there is no list!  While the article is currently a stub and cannot ever be as thorough as it should be sans copyright law, I'm willing to trust that it could turn into something rather useful.  Quadell is quite correct that, even as it stands right now, it accurately describes what the list is and how the names are arranged.

This is a useful referrent point for other articles that might be about people on the list.  Stubs can grow, that being a prime Wikipedia mechanism.  The article is certainly about a more notable topic than 90 percent of the lists that proliferate around here.  If you feel the article is PoV, then don't delete it, edit it to make it neutral PoV, that is the Wikipedia way. [[User:Hu|Hu]] 18:38, 26 February 2006 (UTC) (see also endorsement of user Volatile's vote) *'''Weak Keep'''. I believe the article is still useful (provides something to link to when mentioned in articles about those recognized by the list). Provided that the stub gets cleaned up a bit, the stub should remain. I'm not familiar with this list, but if Time publishes it on a yearly basis, wouldn't it be more appropriate to have a general article &quot;TIME Magazine's 100 Most Influential People&quot; and have all descendent lists (...of 2003, ...of 2004, ...of 2005,etc.) redirect there?

The album featured many trance songs that were receiving a lot of [[dance club]] play at the time, including [[Three Drives on a Vinyl]]'s ''Greece 2000'' and the [[Paul van Dyk]] remix of [[Binary Finary]]'s popular ''1998''.  The later releases in the series were based on this template. DJs featured in this series included [[Dave Ralph]] and [[Quivver]] (''[[Tranceport 2]]'' and ''[[Transport 5]]'', respectively). After Vol. 3, the series changed its name to ''Transport'' to better reflect the evolving popular club sounds and the incorporation of genres other than trance. There were 6 albums in the series, spanning 4 years. In 2003, the most popular trance started changing its sound from the tech-trance featured in the series to a much more epic sound being pushed by DJs like [[Armin van Buuren]], thus lessening the series' popularity{{Fact|date=March 2007}}; it ended for good after Kinetic's [[Bankruptcy|demise]] in early 2004.  == Entries in the series == *1998: [[Paul Oakenfold]] ''[[Tranceport (album)|Tranceport]]'' *1999: [[Dave Ralph]] ''[[Tranceport 2]]'' *2000: [[Sandra Collins]] ''[[Tranceport 3]]'' *2001: [[Max Graham]] ''[[Transport 4]]'' *2001: [[Quivver]] ''[[Transport 5]]'' *2002: [[Trendroid]] ''[[Transport 6]]''  [[Category:DJ mix album series]]</text>     </revision>

His master's [[thesis]] was later published as the Vietnam War novel ''One to Count Cadence'' in 1969.

The use of tools is one of the primary means by which humans are distinguished from animals. Tools are the parents of all other antiques. Most manmade objects were made with the use of tools and great effort goes into the creation of newer and better tools to solve the production problems of the day. The study of antique tools provides a glimpse of human development and cultural preferences through history.  People collect and use antique tools for a variety of reasons - some say they are better made than modern tools, and perform their jobs better. Others appreciate the handcrafting that went into their manufacture or their rarity or aesthetic value. Informally, those preferring hand tools to power tools are sometimes referred to as [[galoot]]s.  The creation of a tool often makes possible the creation of more advanced tools. Advanced tools made possible the manufacture of internal-combustion engines, automobiles, and computers. In the future new devices will come along. But even the most advanced of these owes tribute to the most basic hand tools for their existence. Among those who like to collect, some may do so as part of a rigorous study program - they want to catalog all types of a specific tool, for example. Some collectors may wish to preserve some of the past for future generations. Some may collect as a financial investment. Some collect tools to use them - to be able to create things with them. Others perceive tools as works of art, or as fascinating mechanical design specimens.     With the advent of the Internet, sites have been created to assist collectors in sharing information. For example, those interested in collecting/restoring older power tools can utilize the resources at [http://www.owwm.com/ Old WoodWorking Machines] to locate and/or identify older power tools they may run across. [[Search engines]] can be utilized to locate sites like this for whatever class of tools one may be interested in.  == Tool Collecting Categories == Categories of tools range from the broad - planes, rules, braces, hammers, etc. to the specific - planes made by the Gage Company of Vineland, New Jersey for example. People who are new to the hobby, should know that there are many good modern reference books that will guide you in your search, as well as many reprints of the catalogs in which these tools were originally offered. It is necessary to learn the differences between various tools, their history and the history of their makers. Often tools will exhibit differences contrasting the different locations of their makers, or different features contrasting different time periods.  The following are some ways to begin collecting tools:   * Tools of a specific company or maker - for example, L. Bailey Victor tools, Seneca Falls Tool Company tools, Miller's Falls tools, Disston Saws, Chelor planes, etc.  * Tools of a specific type - hammers, braces, axes, saws, patented planes, transitional planes, treadle-powered machines, etc.  * Tools of a specific period - tools from 1850-1900, post WWII era tools, etc.  * Tools from a specific place - Scottish tools, tools from Massachusetts makers, etc.  * Tools of a specific occupation - cooper's tools, machinist tools, watchmaker's tools, garden tools.  * A combination of one or more of the above categories -- for example, one each of a specific type of Stanley tool, i.e. all Stanley saws, all Stanley marking gauges, all Stanley planes, etc. * A &quot;type study&quot; of one specific model, for example, a type study of Stanley #6 jointer planes or Norris A5 smooth planes. * Tools that show how a specific idea progressed over time, for example tools tracing the development of the plane's adjusting mechanisms, or tools showing how an early patent was bought out and developed by another company.  * Tool advertising and catalogs.  ==See also== * [[Cutting tool]] * [[Diamond tool]] * [[Garden tool]] * [[Hand tool]] * [[Power tool]] * [[Tool]]  ==External links== *[http://www.finetools.com Catalogue of American Patented Antique Tools].

The theatre company focuses primarily on plays from the Shakespeare canon, but its seasons include works by other classic playwrights such as Euripides, Henrik Ibsen and Oscar Wilde. It is a member of the [[League of Resident Theatres]].  The [[Wall Street Journal]] has heralded the company as &quot;the nation's foremost [[Shakespeare]] company&quot;. [http://www.theatermania.com/content/theater.cfm/int_show_id/122329]  Artistic Director [[Michael Kahn (theatre director)|Michael Kahn]] took over what was originally The Shakespeare Theatre at the Folger (part of the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]]) during the 1986-7 season.  Under the name The Shakespeare Theatre, the troupe moved in 1992 to the newly built 451-seat Lansburgh Theatre, its current location, at 450 7th Street NW, Washington, D.C. in the [[Penn Quarter, Washington, D.C.|Penn Quarter]], with administrative offices and rehearsal studios across town on [[Capitol Hill]]. At the start of the 2005-6 season, the present name, Shakespeare Theatre Company, was adopted. It constructed a second nearby theatre named [[Sidney Harman Hall]], which opened on September 15, 2007.  Sidney Harman Hall joined the Lansburgh Theatre in becoming the [[Harman Center for the Arts]]. The Harman Center, named for philanthropist [[Sidney Harman]], will expand theatrical opportunities not just for the Shakespeare Theatre Company but also for other performance groups as well.  In addition to a troupe of regular and frequently appearing actors, Kahn brings acclaimed guest performers and directors each season. The Company also offers a number of educational opportunities, including its Academy for Classical Acting, a one-year Master of Fine Arts graduate program, and school and community programs such as Text Alive! and Students for Shakespeare.  In 1991, the Shakespeare Theatre Company began its annual [[Shakespeare Theatre Company Free For All|Free For All]] productions at the Carter Barron Amphitheatre in D.C.'s [[Rock Creek Park]]. Each summer the company remounts a production from the previous season at the Amphitheatre. These free performances attract D.C.-area residents of all backgrounds and income levels.  In August 2006, the Shakespeare Theatre Company took its production of ''Love’s Labor’s Lost'' to [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] in England to participate in the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]’s [[Complete Works Festival]]. From January to June 30, 2007 The Shakespeare Theatre co-hosted the International [[Shakespeare in Washington Festival]].  Over the past 20 years, the Shakespeare Theatre Company has won 55 [[Helen Hayes Award]]s for acting, directing and technical achievements.

Rush was born on [[January 26]] and grew up in the north end of [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington]]. As a child, she studied classical piano for 10 years.  In 1960, she auditioned for a band (directed by her first husband) that played [[sock hop]]s. Next, she was part of Merrilee and Her Men, doing covers of male pop hits. Then she joined a Seattle rhythm and blues group called Tiny Tony and the Statics.   Merrilee and the Turnabouts was formed in 1965. One of the group's roadies worked for [[Paul Revere and the Raiders]], who were doing a tour in the South in 1967 and invited Merrilee to be their opening act.  Merrilee's rendition of &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; was recorded in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], in early 1968 and was produced by [[Chips Moman]] and the late [[Tommy Cogbill]]. Released by [[Bell Records (1950s-70s)|Bell Records]], it climbed to #7 in the US charts that year, and reportedly reached No. 1 in seven countries. The song garnered Rush a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] Nomination for Female Vocalist of the Year. She was nominated alongside Grammy royalty in [[Barbra Streisand]] (&quot;[[Barbra Streisand discography#Singles|Funny Girl]]&quot;), [[Dionne Warwick]] (&quot;[[Do You Know the Way to San Jose]]&quot;), [[Aretha Franklin]] (&quot;[[I Say a Little Prayer]]&quot;), and [[Mary Hopkin]] (&quot;[[Those Were the Days (song)|Those Were the Days]]&quot;).  She appeared on numerous television shows in the 1960s and 1970s, including ''[[American Bandstand]]'', ''[[The Joey Bishop Show]]'','' Happening'', ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'', ''[[The Everly Brothers Show]]'', ''Something Else'' hosted by John Byner, and many more.  &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; was written by [[Chip Taylor]] (born James Wesley Voight, younger brother of actor [[Jon Voight]] and uncle to actress [[Angelina Jolie]]), who also wrote &quot;Wild Thing&quot;, a hit for [[The Troggs]] in 1966, and &quot;I Can't Let Go&quot;, a hit for [[The Hollies]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].  Rush's recording of &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; was featured prominently in the film ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]'' for which Jolie won an Academy Award. &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; has also been featured in the major motion pictures ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'' and ''[[Fingers (1978 film)|Fingers]]'' starring [[Harvey Keitel]]. Many singers have covered the song, but only the 1981 remake by American pop singer [[Juice Newton]] exceeded Rush's version in popularity.  In 1971, Merrilee signed with [[Scepter Records]] and released one single, a cover of [[Carole King]] song &quot;Child Of Mine&quot;. While that was Merrilee's lone release on Scepter, she cut several tracks for the label including a femme version of the [[Billy Joel]] classic &quot;She's Got A Way&quot; (He's Got A Way). In 1976, Merrilee would sign with [[United Artists Records]]. While at U/A she released three singles, &quot;Could It Be Love I Found Tonight&quot;, &quot;Save Me&quot;, and &quot;Rainstorm&quot;. Her self-titled album for the label was released in 1977.  Merrilee now lives in the countryside near Seattle, in a century-old farm house built by her grandfather. She continues to perform with her own band and in Rock and Roll nostalgia shows across the country. She is married to singer-songwriter and entertainer [[Billy Mac]] and together they have a successful Old English Sheepdog-breeding business.  In 1989 the [[Northwest Area Musicians' Association]] honored Rush with induction into the NAMA Hall of Fame.  In [[2003]] she appeared as herself in the PBS special &quot;At the Drive-In&quot; along with [[Jan Berry]] and [[Dean Torrence]] (of [[Jan and Dean]]), [[Fabian (entertainer)|Fabian]], [[Bobby Vee]], [[Chris Montez]], [[Matthew Nelson]] and [[Gunnar Nelson]] (sons of [[Rick Nelson]]), [[Dodie Stevens]] and others.  Merrilee Rush's &quot;Angel Of The Morning&quot; album has been reissued on compact disc via the [[Collector's Choice Music]] label. The reissue includes the entire original 1968 LP, featuring the Top Ten title track and the follow-up single &quot;[[That Kind of Woman]]&quot; as well as nine non-LP singles and B-sides as bonus tracks. The bonus tracks include a psychedelic version of the Four Tops' &quot;[[Reach Out]]&quot; (an AGP label single release that reached #79 on the Billboard Hot 100), and a cover of [[Burt Bacharach]]'s classic &quot;[[What the World Needs Now]]&quot;, which was produced by [[Quincy Jones]] for the soundtrack album to the film ''[[Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice]]''.  The &quot;Angel Of The Morning&quot; sessions were recorded at Chips Moman's American Studio in Memphis and featured the same musicians who played on Elvis Presley's famous Memphis recordings.   2008 will mark the 40th Anniversary of the release of the Merrilee Rush ''Angel Of The Morning'' single and album.  == External links == * [http://www.merrileerush.com/ Merrilee Rush official site] * [http://www.billymac.com/ Billy Mac official site] * [http://www.classicbands.com/MerrileeRushInterview.html Gary James interview] * [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421649 IMDB's &quot;At the Drive-In&quot; entry]  {{DEFAULTSORT:Rush, Merrilee}} [[Category:Washington musicians]] [[Category:People from Seattle, Washington|Rush, Merrilee]] [[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)|Rush, Merrilee]] [[Category:Living people]]</text>     </revision>

Gaither is most notable for her membership in the recurring cast of comedians on sketch comedy series ''[[MADtv]]''.   ==Early life== Daniele Gaither was born in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]. As a child, Gaither was always the class clown with a knack for storytelling and mimicry. Like her fellow ''MADtv'' castmates [[Nicole Sullivan]] and [[Josh Meyers]], she attended [[Northwestern University]] at [[Evanston, Illinois]]. In 1993, she moved to [[Los Angeles]] to pursue an acting career, and attend the [[The Groundlings|Groundlings School]], where aspiring sketch and improv performers are given a systematic approach to learning improvisation and writing skills.   While she studied at the Groundlings school, Gaither was trained by [[Michael McDonald (actor)|Michael McDonald]], before his tenure on ''MADtv''. She completed the school and became a member of The Groundlings on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood.  After several years as a member, she left the group in 2006.  In her comedy, Gaither tries to &quot;represent people that you see in the streets and know in everyday life,&quot; and sometimes uses her family experiences as material. She does impressions of people that she grew up admiring, such as [[Patti Labelle]], [[Marla Gibbs]] and [[Isabel Sanford]], but also does impressions of current celebrities like [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Star Jones]] and [[Lil Kim]].   Gaither's first regular television appearance was on ''[[Hype (TV series)|Hype]]'' in 2000. After her first big break, she appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Rerun Show]]''. Gaither has a recurring role as Chandra the hairdresser on [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Reno 911!]]''.  ==''MADtv''== Gaither first appeared in an episode of ''MADtv'''s second season, which featured [[Hip hop music|rap]] star [[Ice T]]. The skit was concerned a mock debate between [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] (played by [[Bryan Callen]]) and [[U.S. Senator]] [[Bob Dole]] (played by [[David Herman]]) who transformed himself into a &quot;twisted&quot; version of the 1970s [[blaxploitation]] icon [[Dolemite]]. Gaither played one of Dole's &quot;Dolemite girls.&quot;   [[Image:Eve 1 .jpg|thumb|Daniele Gaither as rap star [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]]]]  Gaither officially joined the cast of ''MADtv'' in 2003, seven years after her initial appearance on the series, as a feature performer for the ninth season. She became the second [[African American]] female cast member in the show's history, when she replaced [[Debra Wilson]]. Gaither was later promoted to a repertory performer status the following season. Some of her characters were only seen one time on the discussion show ''[[Real Mother****ing Talk]]''. Outside of that, some of her best characters included senior citizen Dilly Mae Jackson, ''Taco Hell'' boss Loretta, and Yvoone Criddle, a middle aged woman who openly acknowledges her own [[sociopath]]ic behavior yet simultaneously appears to be oblivious to its perversity.  Gaither portrayed offbeat impersonations of celebrities, which included [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Alani Vasquez|La La]], and [[Tyra Banks]].  Gaither was released from ''MADtv'' by FOX in June 2006.   ===Characters=== * Dellie Mae Jackson (''7 A.M.

He was famed for his frugality with both private and public funds, and was nicknamed &quot;'''Blue Jeans Bill'''&quot; for his humble style of dress.  ==Biography== James Douglas Williams was born on [[January 16]], [[1808]] in [[Pickaway County, Ohio]]. He moved with his family to [[Knox County, Indiana]] at the age of 10, and settled near [[Vincennes, Indiana]] where he remained much of the rest of his life. He received little schooling, but did occasionally attend the log schoolhouse near his home.&lt;ref&gt;Woollen, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Williams' father died in 1828, and being the oldest son, Williams became the caretaker of his family, continuing to run his fathers farm. In 1831 Williams married Nancy Huffman, and together they had seven children. With Williams regularly in the public service, she ran the family farm for much of her life. She suffered a fall in January, 1880 and died on June 27, 1880.&lt;ref name = w148&gt;Woollen, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;  ===Public career===  In 1839 Williams first entered public service serving as [[justice of the peace]] of [[Vincennes, Indiana]] until he resigned in 1843. The same year he was elected to the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] and remained in the General Assembly until 1874, serving in both houses.&lt;ref name = w148/&gt; Williams was responsible for the authorship of many bills, including laws that permitted widows to inherit the estate of their husbands. He wrote the bill that established the state's first sinking fund. He also encouraged the development of the State Board of Agriculture and served as a member for sixteen years, during which time he accumulated a large estate of lands.&lt;ref name  = w149&gt;Woollen, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; William became known for his frugality with both public and private money. He never purchased expensive clothing but instead choose to wear homespun clothes and denim, earning him the nick name &quot;Blue Jeans Bill&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Woollen, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[American Civil War]] Williams' was accused of being a [[copperhead (political)|Copperhead]] when he attempted to interfere with the war effort and submitted legislation to require Governor [[Oliver Morton]] to show what the money in the state emergency fund was being spent on.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1872 he was the Democratic candidate for the [[United States Senate]], but was defeated by [[Oliver Morton]]. Williams was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] from Indiana in 1874 and served from 1875 to 1876. During this time he served as chairman of the committee on accounts and was responsible for considerable reform, and significant saving by cutting business costs. While still in Washington he was informed that his party had nominated him to run for governor, and nomination he was not a candidate for. Instead of declining, he decided to not seek reelection to Congress, but instead returned to Indiana to campaign for governor.&lt;ref name  = w149/&gt;  ===Governor===  Williams was elected governor of Indiana in 1876, defeating future [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Benjamin Harrison]] in a close election, winning by about 5,000 votes. Williams became the only farmer to be elected [[Governor of Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Woollen, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; He was inaugurated on [[January 9]], [[1877]]. During his administration he sought and acquired funds to being the construction of a new state capitol building. He sought to run the government with economy but sought increased funding for the state assistance programs to the war veterans.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p.184&lt;/ref&gt;  He was instrumental in finding the funds for Purdue University and was a &quot;women's rights&quot; activist before such a thing was even known  championing the right for women to own property. He fought for budegetary constraint and was known for his thrifty management of the house's budgetary committee.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in late October 1880, Williams developed a [[kidney infection]]. His health steadily deteriorated and he died shortly before the ends of his term as governor in Indianapolis, on November 20, 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Woollen, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; James Douglas &quot;Blue Jeans&quot; Williams is buried in a rural [[Monroe City, Indiana]] cemetery on ground he donated to establish Walnut Grove Methodist Church near his home.  His family purchased a large obelisk for his grave which was unveiled on July 4, 1883, and it still stands above the tiny Bedford Stone church in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Woollen, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the members of the church are Williams descendants.  == Obituary== The following is Governor Williams obituary in the [[New York Times]].[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E01E0DF123FEE3ABC4951DFB767838B699FDE]  Gov. Williams Dead. The Home-Life and Public Services Of Indiana's Governor. Indianapolis, Indiana Nov. 20- The illness from which Gov. Williams has been suffering for nearly three weeks terminated fatally at 12:30 o'clock today.  Such a result has not been anticipated until within the past 48 hours and even then it was the opinion of his physicians that he might live several days, if not weeks.  For 15 years the Governor has been subject to bladder inflammation, and it was this, aggravated by malarial fever, that caused his death.  He died in the room he has occupied since his incumbency, the Executive office in the Washington Clubhouse, there being with him his physician, the nurse the wife of the janitor of the building, and Judge Scott, of the Supreme Court, and his son, John Williams, who arrived at midnight from Wheatland, Knox County.  the Governor's only other child, Mrs. Eliza Dunn, a widow, was compelled to remain at the homestead, near Wheatland, by sickness.  The Governor's death was very peaceful.  For 12 hours he had been unconscious and he did not rouse at all, but passed away without a word or a muscular quiver.   James Douglas Williams was born in Pickaway County, Ohio, Jan. 16, 1808.  His parents were Virginians.  His grandfather was from Scotland, coming to this country in the middle of the eighteenth century and locating on the James River.  George Williams, the Governor's father, settled in Ohio in an early day in the history of that State and thence removed to Knox County, Indiana where the family home has been ever since.  The Governor's father died in 1828 , leaving him the eldest of a family of six children.  He remained with his mother on the farm until he was 21 years old, when he married Nancy Huffman, the daughter of a neighbor, and the two began a life in a rough location on a quarter section of wild land.  As the result of their work, the Governor leaves probably the finest farm home in Indiana.  His estate, compromising over {{convert|2000|acre|km2}}, is in splendid cultivation, and with comfortable, generous improvements.   Mrs. Williams died a few months ago from the effects of a fall, and five of seven children are also buried on the homestead.  His wife's death greatly affected the Governor.  His associates have noticed a great change in his manner, but never a word of complaint or repining from his lips.  At the old home, a room was always kept for his use, fitted up with a broad fireplace and the furniture to which he had been accustomed to in early life.  At one of his windows, his wife always sat to welcome him on his return home.  Since her death he has not cared to return to the scene of his loss.  He went occasionally, but it was always a trial.  Recently, his daughter missed him from his usual place, and after a long search he was found in the barn, his grief welling up in great sobs that shook his frame.  His domestic life was a happy, homely, modest one.   His public life began in 1839 by election to the office of Justice of the Peace.  In 1841 he was elected to the lower house of the State Legislature by 90 majority, though the county was strongly Whig.  Defeated in 1843, he was elected in 1845, and successively until, in 1858, he was elected to the State Senate, and kept there almost continuously until 1874.  In 1872 he was the caucus nominee of his party for United States Senator to succeed Senator Morton.  In 1874 he was elected Representative from the Second Congressional District to succeed the present Supreme Court Judge Niblack.  At the expiration of his term he came home to take the candidacy of his party for Governor, in 1876 - he having been nominated as a compromise between Franklin Landers and William S. Holman, between whom the convention of 1876 was divided.  He canvassed the State, accompanied by Senator Vorhees and was elected over General Benjamin Harrison by a plurality of 5,500 votes.  The Governor wore a suit of blue jeans, the yarn for which was spun by his wife.  From this fact he was called &quot;Blue Jeans&quot; Williams.&quot;  This habit he kept up until within a short time when he bought a suit of clothes of another color and texture.  For 16 years he was a member of the State Board of Agriculture, and for 4 years was its President.  He was the devoted friend of the common school system of the State in the earlier years of its development, and assisted Gov. Whitcomb and Gov. Wright in laying the foundation for our present splendid school fund.  Probably no man in Indiana was better versed in State legislation, as no man has ever served so long a time in its General Assembly.   Governor Williams was 6 feet, 4 inches in stature, of spare build, weighing only 170 pounds. His personal appearance was such that he was called the Abraham Lincoln of Indiana.  His angular features and ungainly figure, clad in his homespun jeans, made him a curious spectacle.  He was rugged in his virtues, simple in his tastes, Spartan in his honesty, and although uneducated and unpolished, he served the State to the best of his ability, was a pure upright man in all private relations and commanded the respect and confidence of all the people.  His last public appearance was three weeks ago tonight at the dedication of the new dining hall of the House of Refuge at Plainfield.  He took to his bed on the evening of the Presidential election day, Nov. 2.   A meeting of citizens was held tonight attended by prominent men of all parties.  Senator McDonald presided and Secretary of State Shanklin acted as Secretary.  Committees were appointed to arrange for the funeral of Gov. Williams.  The Committee on Memorial is headed by United States Judge Gresham and is to report to a meeting to be held Monday morning at 9 o'clock.  The body will lie in state at the Courthouse from 11 o'clock Monday morning until 5 in the evening.  On Tuesday it will be taken to Vincennes and lie in state 3 hours and be then taken to Wheatland for interment.  Mayor Caven has issued a proclamation asking for the suspension of business between 11 and 12 o'clock Monday morning and 5 and 6 in the afternoon during which hours the body will be moving from the clubhouse to the Courthouse.  A committee consisting of Senator McDonald and General Harrison was appointed to invite the President and Cabinet members of Congress and Governors of adjacent States to attend the funeral.  Telegraphic invitations went forward tonight.  The pall bearers will be ex Govs Hendricks and Baker, Messrs. English and Landers, Gov. Gray, Mayor Caven, Judge Niblack, Gen. Manson, State House Commissioners Nelson and Morris, W.R. McKeen of Terre Haute, and Judge Scott of the Supreme Court.   Columbus, Ohio, Nov 20 - The flags on the State house here are at half mast as a token of respect to the late Gov. Williams of Indiana.   from The New York Times.

'''Leonardo Dati''' (1360&amp;ndash;[[16 march]] [[1425]]) was an Italian friar and humanist. He was [[Master general of the Dominican Order]] from 1414 to his death.  He was a Prior of [[Santa Maria Novella]] from 1401, and took part in the [[Council of Pisa]] of 1409. At the time of the [[Council of Constance]], Dati became Master General of a reunited [[Dominican Order]]. His sermons at [[Pisa]] and [[Constance]] include references to literary texts, and he was well known as an author of commentaries on [[Aristotle]]. Leonardo also gave financial aid to his brother Gregorio [or Goro], a Florentine merchant and diarist.  Both Leonardo and Gregorio Dati are attributed authorship of ''[[La sfera]]'' (The sphere), an astronomical-geographic ''[[Ottava rima|poemetto in ottave]]'', written in the second half of 14th century, and a work much popular in its time. This work in verse gives information about the world, the marinaresche compass and other things, adding observations, notes about travel and designs. In some manuscripts of ''La sfera'' there are designs representing ports, headlands, islands, linked by many lines.  Dati's sermons on the feast of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] (October 1416) and the feast of the [[Circumcision of Jesus]] (January 1417) advocated respect for [[Papal supremacy|papal power]] and reform within the context of the established order. The earlier sermon touched off an exchange of polemical memoranda between Dati and supporters of [[Conciliarism|conciliar supremacy]]. Dati then addressed issues raised in this exchange in the later sermon. Dati's discussion of [[circumcision]] was traditional for his time, describing the [[Brit milah|jewish rite]] as superseded by [[baptism]].  He is buried in the Cappella Rucellai at Santa Maria Novella.  His tombstone is attributed to [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]].  ==External links== * [http://www-db2.helsinki.fi/muisti/muisti.muisti_haku.tulos_sivu?pp_kieli=e&amp;sivuno=0&amp;haetaan_lkm=K&amp;v_no=0&amp;p_tekija=Dati,_Leonardo&amp;p_nimeke=&amp;p_asia= The manuscript of &quot;La sfera&quot; (or &quot;La Sphera&quot;) is a description of the world in poetic form.]  * Thomas M.

His nickname is &quot;Vasa Vasa&quot; [Kiss Kiss] for his tendency to kiss all and sundry - he claims that he has kissed a quarter of all the people on the island.&lt;ref name=ind300506/&gt;  ==Biography== ===Christian Democrat=== A graduate of [[Medicine]] and [[Surgery]] at the [[University of Palermo]], with a specialization in [[radiology]], Cuffaro joined the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] (DC) party during his student days. Then, after having served as City Councillor in his native city, [[Raffadali]], and [[Palermo]], Cuffaro was first elected Member of the [[Sicilian Regional Assembly]] in 1991; in 1996 he served as Regional Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.  His political career began under the wing of former minister [[Calogero Mannino]], who in the past was suspected of having ties with the Mafia. Following the demise of the DC, he became a member of ex-DC splinter parties before joining the party [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] (UDC). He first became known nationally in September 1991, when he defended his political patron Mannino, accused of being a witness at a Mafia wedding, live on television in a joint broadcasting of the [[Maurizio Costanzo]] show and [[Michele Santoro]]’s [[Samarcanda]], accusing the presenters that their journalism was Mafia journalism. In the presence of Antimafia judge [[Giovanni Falcone]] he accused the Sicilian prosecutors of manipulating state witnesses ([[pentito|pentiti]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5MZmJLMQ9Y Costanzo Show: Totò Cuffaro aggredisce Giovanni Falcone], You Tube&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001, after having joined the UDC, Cuffaro was endorsed by the [[House of Freedoms]] as presidential candidate for Sicily. He won the election, with 59.1% of the vote, defeating [[Leoluca Orlando]].

Guttadauro learned that his home was being &quot;bugged&quot; from another doctor. The colleague alleged that he, in turn, had been tipped off by Cuffaro. Guttadauro was recorded describing how the Mafia had funded Cuffaro's 2001 election campaign. According to a transcript, he told that Cuffaro was handed packages of cash &quot;in the least elegant, but most tangible way possible&quot;.&lt;ref name=&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/italy/story/0,12576,1296495,00.html Sicilian governor on mafia charge], The Guardian, September 3, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  On [[January 18]], [[2008]], Cuffaro was found guilty of having helped the Mafia and was given a five-year sentence, during which time he will be suspended from all public offices. Cuffaro was not found guilty of outright collusion with Cosa Nostra but the court concluded he acted in favour of several people sentenced for Mafia crimes and committed breaches of confidentiality. By Italian law, both the sentence and suspension from public office can only begin after the automatic appeals process is concluded. The prosecution had asked that Cuffaro be given an eight-year sentence but judges concluded that while he had helped the Mafia, there had been neither conspiracy nor willful intent. He has denied all wrongdoing and refused to step down, despite that he has also been banned from public office. &quot;I knew I didn't do anything to willfully help the Mafia and tomorrow morning I intend to be back at my desk,&quot; Cuffaro said after the court adjourned.&lt;ref name=ansa180108&gt;[http://www.ansa.it/site/notizie/awnplus/english/news/2008-01-18_118173820.html Sicilian governor gets five years: Salvatore Cuffaro found guilty of helping the Mafia], ANSA, January 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rep180108&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.repubblica.it/2007/10/sezioni/cronaca/cuffaro-processo/cuffaro-sentenza/cuffaro-sentenza.html Mafia, Cuffaro condannato a 5 anni], La Repubblica, January 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc180108&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7197334.stm Sicily chief guilty in Mafia case], BBC News, January 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The day after, Cuffaro handed out [[cannoli]], a Sicilian pastry, as if he was celebrating the sentence that he considered positive because he was not convicted for ties to the Mafia or formally accused of being in cahoots with Cosa Nostra.

His resignation followed reports that the national government was planning a move to oust him. The announcement represents a reversal for Cuffaro, who earlier said he would hang on to his post and appeal his five-year prison sentence of January 18. Many, including some politicians from allied parties, were angry that he celebrated not being convicted of a more serious accusation - helping the Mafia as an organization. The head of Italy's politically influential industrial lobby, [[Confindustria]], lamented that Cuffaro remained in office while Sicilian businessmen were defying the Mafia by increasingly refusing to pay systematic &quot;protection&quot; money. A widely published photo of him offering his aides a tray of cannoli pastries to celebrate fuelled the outrage.&lt;ref name=rep260108b&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.repubblica.it/2007/10/sezioni/cronaca/cuffaro-processo/dimesso-cuffaro/dimesso-cuffaro.html Cuffaro si è dimesso da Governatore], La Repubblica, January 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iht260108&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/01/26/news/Italy-Mafia-Politician.php Sicily's governor resigns after conviction in Mafia case], International Herald Tribune, January 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==External links== *{{it icon}} [http://www.totocuffaro.it/ Official website]  *{{it icon}} [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYLic2Raqa4 Intercettazione ambientale: Boss Guttadauro parla di Cuffaro] from La Mafia è Bianca on YouTube *{{it icon}} [http://www.antimafiaduemila.com/content/view/1644/78/ Cosi il boss scoprì la &quot;cimice&quot;], Antimafia Duemila, December 2007  {{ItalyRegionPresidents}} {{SicilianPres}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Cuffaro, Salvatore}} [[Category:1958 births]] [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:Politicians of Sicily]] [[Category:Members of Union of Christian Democrats]] [[Category:Associates of the Sicilian Mafia]] [[Category:Convicted Italian MPs]]  [[fr:Salvatore Cuffaro]] [[it:Salvatore Cuffaro]] [[pt:Salvatore Cuffaro]] [[scn:Salvatore Cuffaro]]</text>     </revision>

The C8 spyder T has a more powerful Audi 4.2 litre V8 twin turbo with {{Convert|525|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} giving it a top speed of {{Auto km/h|320|0}}. The C8 Laviolette has the {{Convert|400|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} Audi engine but unlike the spyder models that come with either a soft or a hard top, the Laviolette has a glass canopy. The C8 Double 12R is a version made specifically for the [[24 hours of Le Mans]] also using the Audi V8 engine with {{Convert|480|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and the C8 Double 12S is the street version of this car which has the same glass canopy of the Laviolette and optionally has a {{Convert|600|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} engine instead of the {{Convert|400|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} engine from the C8 spyder, giving it a top speed between {{Auto km/h|300|0}} and {{Auto km/h|345|0}} depending on the engine. Both Double 12 versions have a modified C8 spyder frame with a longer wheelbase and a bigger fuel tank, 100 litres instead of 75.  The GT2R is the latest racing model of the car and has {{Convert|450|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and an open top with a metal [[rollcage]]. The Spyker C12 LaTurbie is the most recent road model and also has a long wheelbase but comes with a new 12 cylinder 6.0 litre Audi [[W12 engine]] producing {{Convert|500|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}}. Despite the changed designation, C12 instead of C8, the car's appearance is still similar to that of the C8 models. C12 refers to the twelve cylinders, while the C8 has only eight.  Though similar in name to the C12 LaTurbie, the limited edition [[Spyker C12 Zagato]] is different from the the C8 series.  ==Racing== [[Image:Spyker C8 Spyder GT2R.jpg|thumb|right|One of two C8 Spyder GT2-Rs at the [[2006 24 Hours of Le Mans]].]] The Spyder C8 Double 12R's first race was the [[12 Hours of Sebring]] in 2002, though an accident prevented the car from finishing.

It was hosted by [[Chris Hardwick]].  ==Premise== Two teams competed in a studio literally filled with junk to answer questions based on music videos and pop culture. Each team brought six &quot;prized possessions&quot; from home to risk having destroyed, or &quot;Trashed&quot;, if they did not answer enough questions correctly.  ==Main Game== To start the game, host Hardwick would ask the teams a toss-up question (no points at stake) to determine who would go first. This team then selected a &quot;prized possession&quot; from the other team that they wanted to see &quot;trashed&quot;. After the selection was made, a category (similar to those on ''[[Remote Control (game show)|Remote Control]]'') was given. Three questions, worth 50 points each, were asked; either team could buzz in and answer the question. The defending team had to answer at least two of the three questions correctly to save their object. If they did not, the possession in play was destroyed in front of them violently. (Note that once the fate of the object had been decided, the category was over immediately.) If an object was saved, it could not be chosen again. Each team played with three out of their six possessions per round.  Whether an object was saved or &quot;trashed&quot;, the team who answered the most questions correctly in a set got to select the next item they wanted to see &quot;trashed&quot;. Round two was the same as round one, with the point values being doubled and each team's other three items put into play.  ===Categories=== Each category consisted of three questions dealing with [[pop culture]], [[music video]]s, or random trivia. On occasion, a [[Sketch comedy|skit]] would be presented, after which the contestants would have to answer questions about the skit or from the performers themselves. Examples of categories included &quot;The Naked Trucker&quot; and &quot;Where in the Hell is [[Mayim Bialik]]?&quot; (a satire of the computer game/game show, ''[[Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?]]'')  ===Trashing=== The demolition of prized possessions was carried out by Mark Fite, AKA &quot;Mark the Trasher&quot;, with occasional help from Andrea Wagner, the model/announcer. Depending on the item being destroyed, this could be carried out in many ways: * Blowing the item up inside a blast chamber * Shooting the item with a [[paintball]] gun * Stuffed animals, shoes, and the like were run over with a lawn mower. * The possession was placed against a brick wall, then a [[wrecking ball]] would be sent crashing into the object. * [[Electronics]], such as VCR's and boomboxes, were crushed in a device that looked like a vertical vise with spikes. An autographed basketball was also destroyed with this machine. * Mark would appear to be working out on a [[leg press]] machine; he would extend a full rep and the item was placed underneath the suspended weight stack. He would then remove his legs, allowing the weights to freefall and crush the object. * Shoes and boots were destroyed by placing them on a [[mannequin]] sitting in a shoe shine booth; the boots were then &quot;shined&quot; using a sander, destroying them. * Clothes were destroyed by cutting them up with scissors or a knife, or swinging them around on a [[chainsaw]]; on one occasion, a shirt was placed on a giant doll of [[Beavis and Butt-Head|Beavis or Butt-Head]] (clearly to promote that show, which was just starting out and becoming popular.) Mark then proceeded to pour bleach on both Beavis and Butt-Head, ruining the shirt; it was then sliced apart with a knife. * [[Baseball cards]] and [[compact disc|CD's]] were destroyed by placing them in a box filled with sand, then running over them with a belt sander, ruining both sides. * [[Televisions]] and [[cassette tape]] collections were often destroyed by throwing heavy objects onto them from a balcony constructed on stage. * [[Surfboard]]s were sawn into pieces with a chainsaw. * If at any time the &quot;trashing&quot; did not work as planned, Mark the Trasher would simply finish the job himself using a [[sledgehammer]]. * On one occasion, the item at stake was an autographed [[baseball]]; they brought out a paint can full of hot tar in which to submerge it. However, Mark decided that the baseball was too expensive and instead threw it into the audience. * On another occasion, a male contestant with long blonde hair put his hair on the line as one of his &quot;prized possessions&quot;; upon getting these questions wrong, staff members began cutting his hair and continued to do so for the remainder of the main game.  ==Lightning Round== Round three was called the &quot;Survival Round&quot;. One contestant from each team had to answer questions (at 150 points each) while the other contestant was &quot;imprisoned&quot;. At the end of 39 seconds (not a typo), the team in the lead won the game. The &quot;imprisoned&quot; contestant on the losing team was then &quot;trashed&quot; him/herself (either [[Public humiliation|publicly humiliated]], [[slime]]d, or made to come face to face with their &quot;worst fear&quot;.) The winners moved on to the final round, while the losers left with a tacky parting gift such as a [[Simpsons]] [[chess|chess set]] and were also required to do 10 hours [[community service]] (to go with the &quot;trash&quot; theme.)  ==Bonus Round== The bonus round was a cross between the one used on ''Remote Control'' and the Winner's Circle round on the ''[[Pyramid (game show)|$25,000 Pyramid]]''. The players on the winning team were seated face to face, with three television monitors behind each player, each showing a music video. One at a time, one player would tell the other what was showing on one of the videos behind them, and the second player would have to identify the artist of said video. Correctly identifying all six videos/artists within the time limit won the grand prize.  The time given in the bonus round depended on how well the team did in the upfront game; 30 seconds were given with an additional five seconds tacked on for every possession that team saved; hence, saving all six possessions resulted in the team having 60 seconds to identify all the videos (Hardwick's usual explanation for this situation was, &quot;Normally, we give you 30 seconds, but you saved everything, so I'm going to give you full time&quot; (or something similar), after which he would ask for the timer to be set to 60 seconds).  ==Ongoing gags/jokes== ''Trashed'' had several ongoing comedy bits that were emphasized, usually involving the trash theme and/or humiliating the contestants. * The word &quot;Loser&quot; was used excessively in this show. At the end of the game, before the &quot;consolation prizes&quot; and winners' prizes were announced, host Hardwick would usually say something to the effect of &quot;on Trashed, there are no winners, just losers!&quot; A sound bite saying &quot;Loser!&quot; was sometimes used when a contestant got a question wrong; the word was also displayed on a screen during the bonus round if one contestant gave an invalid clue. The connotation was furthered with the [[Beck]] song [[Loser (song)|Loser]], which was popular at the time. * The questions very often included bathroom or sexual humor; this is commonplace for MTV, but some of it was very clearly meant to test the boundaries of acceptable material on the network. This pushing of the envelope may go hand-in-hand with the experimenting with crudeness done on other relatively new MTV shows at the time, most notably ''Beavis and Butt-Head.'' * Before the bonus round was played, the &quot;rules&quot; to the bonus round and a disclaimer were read at an incomprehensibly fast speed by the announcer as they scrolled rapidly across the screen. * If a team won the bonus round, Mark the Trasher would shoot [[confetti]] onto the contestants through a modified [[leafblower]] from the balcony; later in the season, he would begin shooting random objects such as regular pieces of paper through the leafblower, and finally this would occur whether the team won or lost. * Songs played in the background while the end credits rolled included [[What Is Love (song)|What Is Love]] by [[Haddaway]], and [[Mr. Vain]] by [[Culture Beat]]. These songs were popular in 1994 and usually had a connotation of someone hurting someone else, further emphasizing the destructive nature of the show.  ==Additional Notes== * ''Trashed'' is one of the earliest of several game shows that has employed destruction of prizes and/or property as one of its gimmicks. Other such shows have included ''[[Big Deal (game show)|Big Deal]]'', a knockoff of the classic show ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' in which certain deals involved contestants damaging and/or destroying their own possessions in an effort to win better prizes; ''[[I Bet You Will]]'', another MTV program in which random people were selected off the streets or other public venues to perform outrageous stunts and/or have their possessions destroyed for money; ''[[Distraction (game show)|Distraction]]'', a British show later also produced for [[Comedy Central]] in which contestants were humiliated and distracted while answering questions, with the winner having to save his or her prizes from damage and/or destruction; and ''[[Beat the Crusher]]'', another British game show in which contestants had their prized possessions destroyed as a tradeoff for money and/or punishment for losing games, with the final competition involving two couples gambling their cars in an attempt to win another one (the loser's car was dropped into a [[compactor|junkyard crusher]] and smashed.)  ==External links== * {{imdb title|id=0189316|title=Trashed}} * [http://www.prehensile.com/tales/trashed/trashed.htm One contestant's experience]  [[Category:1990s American television series]] [[Category:Cable game shows]] [[Category:MTV game shows]] [[Category:1994 television series debuts]] [[Category:1995 television series endings]]</text>     </revision>

Most people in the [[Eskimo]] population are M/M, while this genotype is rare among [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]]. In fact, they tend to possess the opposite genotype (N/N).  The MN blood group system is under the control of an [[autosomal]] locus found on chromosome 4 out of 23, with two alleles designated LM and LN. The bloodtype is due to a [[glycoprotein]] present on the surface of red blood cells, which behaves as a native [[antigen]]. [[Phenotypic]] expression at this locus is [[codominant]] because an individual may exhibit either one or both antigenic substances. Frequencies of the two [[alleles]] vary widely among human populations.
